# Internal Forces

The resultant force on an axial member must act along it.

Mechanism if the structure can move. Statically determinate if $Dj=b + r$, and consists only of triangles.

Superposition: The force in a member when forces $W_1$ and $W_2$ act together, is the sum of the forces when $W_1$ and $W_2$ act separately.

If the once external force acting on a body is reversed, the structure is antisymmetric, all axial forces are multiplied by $-1$.

Check in the data book for the direction of shear force and bending moment when you cut through a bar

For a continuous arch, with no external forces acting on it, the reaction force at the base acts through the central connection point, where the arch is horizontal.

Split a weight distribution into a uniform part and a variable part.
$$\rho \times A_{projected}=\sigma_{normal}\times A_{cut}$$

For a hollow sphere or longitudinal stress in a hollow cylinder: $\sigma_{L}=\frac{\rho R}{2t}$

For the circumferential stress in a hollow cylinder: $\sigma_{C}=\frac{\rho R}{t}$

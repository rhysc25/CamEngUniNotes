# External Forces

The moment of a force about point O: $\textbf{M}_O=\textbf{r}\times \textbf{F}$

The moment of a couple is the same about any point. Any force can be replaced by a couple and the corresponding, oppositely acting moment.

The sum of the moments of forces about a point = the moment of the resultant force about that point.

The magnitude of the component of a pressure force on an object in a given direction is equal to the pressure multiplied by the projected area of that object (see semicircle example in lecture notes)

The total pressure acting to the right is PD, and acting both upwards and downwards is PD/2

The force equivalent to a hydrostatic pressure distribution can be found by integration: $\frac{\rho g}{2}(h_2^2-h_1^2)$

And the equivalent point at which this force acts, $h_{equ}=\frac{2}{3}\frac{(h_2^3-h_1^3)}{(h_2^2-h_1^2)}$

The analysis of structures is greatly simplified by replacing a force distribution with one force: $\textbf{F}\bar{x}=\int x f(x)dx$

Contact forces always act perpendicularly to the surface of contact

* For static contact (no sliding): $|\textbf{F}|\leq \mu_s \textbf{N}$, $|\psi|\leq \psi_s$
* For dynamic contact (sliding): $|\textbf{F}|= \mu_d \textbf{N}$, $|\psi|= \psi_d$

The angle of friction is always taken from the common normal. $\tan(\psi_s)=\mu_s$, $\tan(\psi_d)=\mu_d$

We can find the ratio of tensions over a rough pulley by taking a differential segment and resolving forces. $\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\exp[{\mu_s d}]$

If a body is in equilibrium under $3$ forces, then all forces must be concurrent, acting through a common point. A pin joint constrains 2 degrees of freedom, a roller 1, and an encastre 3.

Taking sections of a diagram and creating free body diagrams, and taking moments about a point where many forces act through, is often the fastest way to solve a problem

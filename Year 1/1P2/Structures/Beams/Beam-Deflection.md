# Beam Deflection

The curvature of a plane curve is the rate of turning of the tangent to the curve. $k=\frac{d\psi}{ds}=-\frac{d^2v}{dx^2}=\frac{1}{\rho}$, where $\rho$ is the radius of curvature.

We use the approximation that $x \approx s$ for the deflected beam, similar to when considering hanging bridges. All the angles are small angles.

To solve, given q: $$S=\int q dx \Rightarrow M = \int Sdx\Rightarrow M=Bk\Rightarrow \psi = -\int kdx\Rightarrow v= \int \psi dx $$

We are given standard results for the deflections of different loading states of beams.

If a beam is statically indeterminate, we superpose two determinate states, one with one force and one with the other, over each other and equate opposite deflections.

We determine the deflections of complex beams through superposition. The deflection of one plus the deflection of the other.

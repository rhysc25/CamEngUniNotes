# Bending Moment Diagrams (BMDs)

A bending moment diagram shows the variation in bending moment as you move through the beam.

There is discontinuity in the shear force diagram if there is a point load.

M is 0 at the simply supported ends of the beam. This is not true if its an encastre and there's moments at the supports.

When moving along a beam, if no force is met, the bending moment diagram changes linearly, and the shear force diagram is constant.

$$q=\frac{dS}{dx} \hspace{1cm} S=\frac{dM}{dx}$$

For a frame or floating structure, the process is the same.

If only point loads act on the object, find bending moments at the key points, then join with straight lines.

It is convention for the bending moment diagram to be drawn on the structure, always on the tension side of each member.

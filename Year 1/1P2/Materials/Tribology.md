# Tribology: Friction, Wear and Lubrication

At the microscopic scale, contact between surfaces initially occurs at only a few points called asperities.

The true contact area, $A_t<$ the nominal contact area $A_n$.

Therefore, the stress is going to be much higher.

We can treat each asperity as a little hardness test, so $w_k=Ha_k$, where $w_k$ is the local load. 
$W=\sum w_k = H A_t$.

Warning: We can't use these relations for polymers or ceramics, as they do not deform plastically in the same way or at all.

When metal surfaces touch, the contacting asperities plastically deform and flatten, forming adhesive junctions.

The surfaces will only slide if the shear stress $\tau_k$ on each junction is greater than the material shear stress $\tau_s$.

$F=\sum f_k=\sum \tau_k a_k \approx \tau_s\sum a_k=\tau_s A_t=\tau_s \frac{W}{H}\approx \frac{W}{6}$

Using $\tau_s \approx k$.

$\mu =\frac{F}{W}=\frac{1}{6}$

As almost all metals have an oxide layer in air, $\mu=\frac{F}{W}=\frac{\tau_s (oxide)}{H(metal)}$

For metals with no oxide layer, the true area approaches the nominal area. The frictional shear stress tends to the yield shear stress. This limit is called sticking friction.

This is used in friction welding.

For example spin welding, where the friction removes the oxide layer, then sticking friction occurs when the two pieces are pushed into each other.

Another example is vibration and ultrasonic welding, used with thermoplastics.

Wear rate: The wear rate Q is defined as

$Q=$ volume of material removed from contact surface/sliding distance

$Q\propto \frac{W}{H}/A_t$. $Q=K\frac{W}{H}$.

Two types:

Adhesive wear: when both surfaces have the same hardness. Material transfer at the adhesive junctions, then wear particles break off.

Abrasive wear: when one surface is hard and the other is soft. Wear particles are broken off the weaker surface.

Lubrication is a low shear stress film. It is used to avoid excessive heat generation.

In static or low velocity situations, there is contact between the surfaces, which is called boundary lubrication. This occurs when the thing is being started up or shut down.

Once the velocity increases, the shaft becomes increasingly supported by the oil phase. The thickness of the oil and the oil pressure increases. Eventually the shaft is fully supported by the oil. This is called hydrodynamic lubrication.

There is an optimum point for lubrication.

If the velocity increases any further then the fluid drag would hinder the shaft.

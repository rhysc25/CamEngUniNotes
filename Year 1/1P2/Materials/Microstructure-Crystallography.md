# Introduction to Microstructure and Crystallography

Most engineering metals and ceramics are made up of many small crystals, or grains, stuck together at grain boundaries to make polycrystalline microstructures.

Most solid solutions will be substitutional: atoms of similar size replace one another in the lattice (e.g. Cu-Zn: in brass)

Only small atoms (e.g. H, C) form interstitial solid solutions: these atoms can fit into the gaps between metal atoms (e.g. C in Fe: in carbon steels)

## Primary and Secondary Bonds

**Primary bonds (intermolecular forces):**
- Metallic (Non-directional)
- Ionic (Non-directional)
- Covalent (Directional)

Primary bonds may be modelled as stiff springs between atoms (or ions), with a non-linear force-separation characteristic

![Primary Bond Characteristic](Primary%20Bond%20Characteristic.png)

Equilibrium separation r₀, governed by the balance between attractive and repulsive forces. At the dissociation separation the atoms (or ions) can be separated completely.

Atoms vibrate about the equilibrium separation, with kinetic energy >> k₍B₎T, where T is the absolute temperature (in K) and k₍B₎ is Boltzmann's constant (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J per atom K⁻¹). All bonds effectively break down when k₍B₎T exceeds the bond energy – at this point the material melts.

## Crystal Structures

The great majority of the 92 stable elements are metallic, and of these, the majority (68 in all) have one of just three simple structures (treating the atoms as hard spheres):
- Face-centred cubic (FCC)
- Close-packed hexagonal (CPH)
- Body-centred cubic (BCC)

### Close-packed crystal structures

The basic building block for the first two of these structures is the close-packed plane (i.e. the highest density of atoms arranged in a plane is a hexagonal packing).

![Close-packed Plane](Close-packed%20Plane.png)

However there are two ways of packing these close-packed planes: ABA and ABC stacking. They are similar, but one has a plane rotated by 60 degrees.

![ABA and ABC Packing](ABA%20and%20ABC%20Packing.png)

- **Face-centred cubic, FCC** - ABC stacking
- **Close-packed hexagonal, CPH** - ABA stacking

The apparently minor packing difference is of little consequence for elastic properties, but has a big influence on plastic deformation.

### Unit cells

A unit cell is the smallest unit which can be replicated by translation in all directions to build up the 3D crystal structure. The unit cell dimensions are called the lattice constants.

Unit cells are drawn with the atoms reduced in size, for clarity – remember that they touch in close-packed directions.

### Face-centred cubic (FCC) structure

The FCC structure is described by a cubic unit cell with one atom at each corner and one at the centre of each face. The close-packed planes (ABC....) are perpendicular to the cube diagonals.

![FCC Structure](FCC%20Structure.png)

FCC metals have the following characteristics:
- They are very ductile when pure, work hardening rapidly but softening again when annealed, allowing them to be rolled, forged, drawn or otherwise shaped by deformation processing.
- They are generally tough, i.e. resistant to crack propagation (as measured by their fracture toughness, K₁c – covered in the Easter Term lectures).
- They retain their ductility and toughness to absolute zero, something very few other materials allow.

### Close-packed hexagonal (CPH) structure

The CPH structure is described by a prismatic hexagonal unit cell with an atom at each corner, one at the centre of the hexagonal faces and three in the middle.

![CPH Structure](CPH%20Structure.png)

There are two lattice constants in CPH – the side-length of the hexagonal base, a, and the height of the prism, c.

There are three close-packed directions in the close-packed planes, as before, but this ABAB… stacking does not generate close-packed planes or directions in other orientations (in contrast to FCC).

CPH metals have the following characteristics:
- They are reasonably ductile (at least when hot), allowing them to be forged, rolled, and drawn, but in a more limited way than FCC metals.
- Their structure makes them more anisotropic than FCC metals (i.e. crystal properties vary with direction).

### Body-centred cubic (BCC) structure

The BCC structure is described by a cubic unit cell with one atom at each corner and one in the middle of the cube (see Figure). This structure is not close-packed – it is made by stacking planes of atoms in a square array (not hexagonal). Atoms touch along the cube diagonals, so these are the close-packed directions.

![BCC Structure](BCC%20Structure.png)

BCC metals have the following characteristics:
- They are ductile, particularly when hot, allowing them to be rolled, forged, drawn or otherwise shaped by deformation processing.
- They are generally tough, and resistant to crack propagation (as measured by their fracture toughness, K₁c) at and above room temperature.
- They become brittle at low temperatures. The change happens at the "ductile-brittle transition temperature", limiting their use below this.

## Grain Structure

Solidification is completed when adjacent crystals impinge on one another. But because the orientation of the packing in each crystal is random, there is a misfit in the atomic packing at the interface between two crystals. The individual crystals are called grains, and the region of imperfect packing is called a grain boundary.

Hence the theoretical density = mass/volume for the unit cell:

ρ = (nA)/(Vₒ Nₐ)

Key points to note: Since the atomic mass and the crystal packing are both physically well-defined:
- densities of metals and ceramics have narrow ranges
- there is no scope to modify density (e.g. by processing a metal differently).

## Interstitial Space

An interstitial space (or hole) is the space between the atoms or molecules. The FCC, CPH and BCC structures contain interstitial space of two sorts: tetrahedral and octahedral.

![Interstitial Space](Interstitial%20Space.png)

Interstitial holes are important because small foreign atoms can fit into them. For FCC and CPH structures, the tetrahedral hole can accommodate, without strain, a sphere with a radius of 0.22 of that of the host. The octahedral holes are almost twice as large.

Interstitial solute atoms are particularly important for carbon steel, which is iron with carbon in some of the interstitial holes. Iron is BCC (at room temperature), and only contains tetrahedral holes (shown in Figure (c) above). These can hold a sphere with a radius 0.29 times that of the host, without strain. Carbon will go into these holes, but because it is a bit too big, it distorts the crystal structure. It is this distortion that gives carbon steels much of their strength.

## Ceramic crystals

Technical ceramics are the hardest, most refractory structural materials – examples are given in the tables below. The ceramic family also includes many functional materials (semiconductors, piezo-electrics, ferromagnetic etc.). Their structures often look complicated, but can mostly be interpreted as atoms of one type, arranged on a simple FCC, CPH or BCC lattice, with the atoms of the second type (and sometimes a third) inserted into the interstitial holes of the first lattice. There are four main crystal structures for engineering ceramics: diamond cubic, halite, corundum and fluorite.

### Diamond cubic (DC) structure

Carbon, silicon and germanium atoms have a 4-valent nature – each atom prefers to have 4 nearest neighbours, symmetrically placed around them. The DC structure achieves this.

![DC Structure](DC%20Structure.png)

If you first ignore the numbered atoms, the remainder form an FCC lattice; the atoms numbered 1-4 are then additional atoms located in half of the tetrahedral interstitial spaces.

### Oxides with the Corundum structure

A number of oxides have the formula M₂O₃, among them alumina, Al₂O₃. The oxygen, the larger of the two ions, is close-packed in a CPH stacking. The M atoms occupy two thirds of the octahedral holes in this lattice.

## Glasses

When crystalline materials melt, the atoms lose their regular packing but are still loosely held together; on solidification, crystals usually form readily. Glasses are all based on silica, SiO₂, for which crystallisation is difficult. In the solid state silica usually has an amorphous (or glassy) structure, and only crystallises if cooled very slowly.

## Polymer microstructure

### Bonding in polymers

Polymers are long-chain molecules of carbon.

Primary bonding between the C atoms is by strong covalent bonds – both along the chains, and at cross-links (where two chains are bonded together). Secondary bonding acts between the chains (via the side-groups) by weak van der Waals bonds.

### Microstructure in polymers

There are three main classes of polymer: thermoplastics, thermosets and elastomers. In all cases the long-chain molecules pack together randomly, giving an amorphous "spaghetti-like" microstructure. The classes are then distinguished by the detail in the molecular architecture, in particular, whether the extent of covalent cross-linking between chains.

### Thermoplastics

Thermoplastics contain no cross-links (covalent bonds between the chain molecules), but are divided into two sub-groups: amorphous and semi-crystalline.

![Thermoplastic Polymers](Thermoplastic%20Polymers.png)

In amorphous thermoplastics, the long-chain molecules are arranged entirely at random, with occasional entanglement points between chains. At these points there is no additional bonding, but they do restrain the deformation and sliding of the molecules.

Semi-crystalline thermoplastics are partly amorphous, and partly ordered in crystalline regions (known as "spherulites"). In crystalline regions, the long chains line up and pack to give an ordered, repeating structure, just like any other crystal.

### (2) Elastomers and (3) Thermosets

Elastomers contain a small number of cross-links, between simple chain molecules. Natural rubber is an example, in which the cross-links are provided by sulphur. Further cross-linking can be triggered in service (e.g. by UV light or ozone), leading to polymer degradation.

Thermosets, in contrast, have extensive cross-links between chains.

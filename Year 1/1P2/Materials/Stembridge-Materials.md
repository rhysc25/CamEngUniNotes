# Stembridge Materials

- **Poisson's ratio** - The ratio of lateral strain to tensile strain in the loading direction.
- **Brittle materials** fracture at their elastic limit.
- **Strength** - The max uniaxial stress that can be applied and the material remains elastic

**Strain-to-failure** also known as ductility

**Stiffness-limited design**: a maximum allowable deflection under the design load  
**Strength-limited design**: a maximum allowable load can be applied while remaining in the elastic regime.

Bending stresses are due to bending moments:

The maximum stresses occur at the surface â€“ so the limiting value for the material is reached here first.

# Fracture

The stress concentration factor is σmax/σ₀ where σ₀ is the remote stress and σmax is the maximum value of stress by the defect.

The elastic strain per unit volume = U = ½σ₀ε₀.

As a crack gets longer, the volume of stress-free material shielded by the crack increases.  
The strain energy release rate is the rate at which stored elastic strain energy is released with respect to the creation of new crack area.  
Strain energy release rate, G = dW/new crack area = πσ₀²a/E

Lines of force concentrate at a crack tip.

For a sharp crack: the stress in front of the crack, σyy = K/√(2πx) where K is the stress intensity factor, a measure of the crack tip loading.  
K = Yσ√(πa) where Y is a dimensionless constant.  
These are all given. For a centre crack we must take a as half the total crack length.

Fracture is expected when K reached the fracture toughness, the critical value. K ≥ KIC (stress based analysis). Alternatively its when G reaches the fracture energy.  
K = √(EG). (In the data book). Both measures of loading at the tip of a sharp crack.

There are three basic modes of loading, which will have different K: Opening, sliding/in-plane-shearing/tearing:

Ductile materials have a plastic zone at the tip of the crack, which raises the radius of curvature, becoming more blunt, hence reducing the stress. There is extensive energy absorption.  
In the data book: rp = KIC²/(πσy²), where rp is the size of the process/plastic zone.  
K can only be used to predict fracture if the process zone size is small, so less than the order of the crack length.

In general as yield stress increases, fracture toughness decreases.  
Fracture toughness is often measured by the energy absorbed during an impact test.  
As we lower the temp, the dislocations become less mobile, fracture toughness falls, so less energy absorbed.  
Except for fcc metals, which are unaffected by temperature.

Ductile - Plasticity concentrates stress on inclusions, causing voids to grow and coalesce, ultimately causing fracture.  
Brittle - Very few voids. The energy absorbed during brittle fracture is much less.

## Ceramics

The fracture of ceramics is dominated by their brittle nature, either occurring through grains (transgranular) or along the grain boundary (intergranular).

Tensile failure starts with worst flaw, considering orientation and size.  
Ceramics do not have a very well defined tensile strength as the crack distribution, size and orientation is random, and largely dependant on manufacture.

Compressive failure is initiated in mode II, occurring on the planes of maximum shear stress, at 45 degrees to the loading axis.  
Failure under compressive load requires a much higher driving force than tension, mainly due to frictional work as the crack flanks slide over each other. ⇒ KIIC > KIC.  
Ceramics are weak in tension and relatively strong in compression.

## Composites

Composites: The individual elements are brittle, but combining gives a very large fracture toughness.  
The main energy-absorbing mechanism raising the toughness of fibre composites is the pulling of fibres out of their sockets in the matrix due to crack advance. This is called frictional sliding.

The interfacial shear stress opposes the opening of the crack. The fibres bridge the crack.

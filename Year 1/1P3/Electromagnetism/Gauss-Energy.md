# Electromagnetics - Gauss + Energy

There is zero electric flux parallel to a conducting wire.

The flux of $\textbf{D}$ through a closed surface S is Q

We only calculate $\textbf{D}$ using perpendicular components from the surface.

$$Q=\sum_S \textbf{D}\cdot\textbf{dS}$$

If unstated, the outer conductor has equal and opposite charge per unit length.

$V_2-V_1=-\int E dy$. If this spans two or more dielectric materials, we have to split the integral into two or more parts.

Choose to calculate D along a straight line.

For finding the capacitance of two parallel wires, determine the electric flux density along the line due to each separately, then superpose and add together.

The distance will be from the edge of one wire to the edge of the other.

An equipotential is a line or surface of constant potential. They are lines along which we could move a point charge without having to do any work against electric fields.

Equipotential lines are always perpendicular to the electric field lines, because if a charge is travelling perpendicular to a field line, it isn't doing any work.

We can replace an equipotential surface with a conductor. No work is done is moving charge along the surface.

Therefore two opposite charges are equivalent to a charge next to a grounded conducting plate.

Alternatively, we can take a charge next to a grounded conducting plate and, using the method of images, place an image of an opposite charge double the distance to the plane away, which is much easier to work with.

This is of course only approximate, as in reality the charge distribution would be distorted by the metal plane.

Energy stored on a capacitor $=\frac{1}{2}CV_{final}^2$

The electric field stores the energy of the capacitor.

Combining other capacitor equations: $\frac{W}{Ax}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_r \epsilon_0 E^2$, which is the energy density in the electric field.

The electrostatic force F in a direction x is given by: $F=\frac{1}{2}V^2\frac{\partial C}{\partial x}$

Determine an expression for capacitance in terms of x, and differentiate.

A dielectric pushed into a capacitor is equivalent to two capacitors in parallel, so their capacitances sum.

Deriving virtual work equation: Imagine a fixed region of charge -q and a movable region of charge +q, with a constant voltage V between them. Imagine there is a force keeping them separate. Imagine the +q moves a distance dx towards the other conductor. The capacitance will change by dC, so a charge dq will be added

The work done by the battery is Vdq. The mechanical work is -Fdx. The change in electrostatic energy is $\frac{1}{2}$Vdq.

$-Fdx+Vdq=\frac{1}{2}Vdq$, rearrange to give virtual work equation.

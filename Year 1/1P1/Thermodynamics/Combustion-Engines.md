Carnot engines are impractical as the isothermal heat transfer is too slow, requiring infinitesimal $\Delta T$. As well as this, the P-V diagram is very slender, so the work output is sensitive to small imperfections

If we recycle the heat rejected in a Stirling engine, it has the same efficiency as a Carnot cycle

Stages in the Stirling cycle:
1) Isothermal compression at temperature $T_2$
2) Constant volume heat addition 
3) Isothermal expansion at temperature $T_1$
4) Constant volume heat rejection

Combustion engine types:
* Spark ignition engines: air and fuel ignited by a spark (petrol engine)
* Compression ignition engines: air is compressed, fuel is sprayed in and ignites as soon as it has evaporated

The four stroke cycle:
1) Induction stroke: Gas and fuel drawn in
2) Compression stroke: The gas is compressed then lit
3) Power stroke: Gas expands and pushes piston down
4) Exhaust stroke: Pushes burnt air and fuel out

The Air-Standard Otto cycle assumes isentropic compression and expansion, and has equivalent four sections:

1) Constant volume heat rejection
2) Isentropic compression
3) Constant volume heat addition
4) Isentropic expansion

The compression ratio $r_v=$ max volume/min volume

The theoretical efficiency of the Otto cycle: $\eta_{otto}=1-\frac{1}{r_v^{\gamma -1}}$, depending only on the volumetric ratio

The main parameters affecting power output are: 
1) Cylinder volume: More air to burn
2) RPM: More cycles in the same time, greater power output
3) Air-fuel ratio

CI engines tend to be slower, as the gas needs time to evaporate

For conventional SI engines, power is controlled by throttling, which generates a lot of entropy.
In CI engines, the power is controlled by the fuel injection

# Ordinary Differential Equations

First order ODEs can be solved by: Direct integration, separation of variables, integrating factor, treating as a second order, or by reducing it to a separable form

Reducing to a separable form, Eg.
$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x^2-xy+y^2}{x^2}$. As we can see, scaling the variables by a constant factor $\lambda$ would not change the equation, so we can reduce this. Using $u=\frac{y}{x}$ and $\frac{d(ux)}{dx}=x\frac{du}{dx}+u$

We can use the differential operator, $D$, where $Dy=\frac{dy}{dx}$ or $\frac{dy}{dt}$ or whatever

To solve a problem using differential elements:
1. Draw a diagram of the element
2. Resolve forces/moments or balance energy
3. Take $\delta x \rightarrow 0$ to obtain an ODE, and solve

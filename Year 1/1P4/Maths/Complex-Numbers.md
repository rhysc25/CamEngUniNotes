# Complex Numbers

$|z+a|+|z+b|=k$ is the loci of an ellipse in the complex plane

From Euler's formula: $2\cos(x)=e^{jx}+e^{-jx}$ and $2j\sin(x)=e^{jx}-e^{-jx}$

Euler's formula can be used to evaluate integrals quickly, Eg. turning $\sin(x)$ into $\Re(e^{ix})$

We can switch the order of a summation of an integral to the integral of a summation, as they are essentially the same thing, keeping variables within the integral

Remember the $\sin(ix)=i\sinh(x)$ identities in the data book

$\ln(z)=\ln(r)+j\theta$

For a polynomial with real coefficients, complex roots will always come in conjugate pairs, and this can be proven by taking the complex conjugate of the entire polynomial.

$$\frac{R}{R+j(\omega L-\frac{1}{\omega C})}=\frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2+(\omega L -\frac{1}{\omega C})}}\exp[-j\tan^{-1}(\frac{\omega L-\frac{1}{\omega C}}{R})]$$

This resonates when $\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$, meaning that the impedance is purely real

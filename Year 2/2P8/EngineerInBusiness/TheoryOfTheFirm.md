Firm - an organisation consisting of 1 or more individuals working as a decision making unit to produce goods or services. E.g. public or private limited company
Market - an institution for resource allocation

Neoclassical Theory of a Firm:
$Q=K^{0.5}L^{0.5}$ where Q is the constant output and capital K and labour L are the inputs
The optimal depends on the relative price of K and L

**Transaction Cost View of a Firm**
Transaction cost: Search and information, bargaining and decision, policing and enforcement
Firm characterised by incomplete contracts, they economise on transaction cost
The reason why all production is not done at one firm: The transactions are spatially dispersed and dissimilar
**Property Rights View of a Firm**
Ownership of many parts of a good or service matters because it carries residual control, and it's better that one entity has control over it's direction
**Marxist View of a Firm**
Firms exist to control the value of production rather than to improve efficiency
**Managerial View of a Firm**
Managers maximise their own welfare over the good of the company
**Behavioural Theory**
Firms engage in gift exchange with their employees to boost moral and productivity
**Capability View of a Firm**
The firm only exists as it has knowledge of what to do, and is correctly placed to do that thing
**Evolutionary Theory of a Firm**
Competition is a process, like natural selection. Innovation drives structural change.

**The Growth of a Firm**
Economies of scale - making things in bigger quantity is cheaper per item than making just a few.

**Supply Size**
Static and dynamic factors affecting the growth of a firm:
* Shape of a long run average cost (LRAC) curve
* Minimum efficient scale (MES)
![[Pasted image 20260203144835.png]]
Over time the average cost increases as we need to start pooling resources from further away

**Demand Size**
Economies of scope - It’s cheaper to produce a variety of products using the same resources.

The relationship between growth ad profitability -
Growth depends on profitability, but growth is not always a desirable strategy

Constrains on firm growth:
Management skill ad objectives. Available finance. Market size. Technology. Timing in the macroeconomy. The role of management can limit growth as old managers have to take time and resources to teach new managers.

If growth and contraction are equally likely in any given timeframe, this will lead to growth as the long tail grows.
Growth is heavily skewed, most innovation occurs in the top 20%.
When a new technology is discovered, there is a large influx of companies, followed by exit, and only a few dominating companies remain.

External growth of a firm:
Horizontal integration is when firms merge which create the same product.
Vertical integration is when firms merge which produce different stages of the same product. This is good as they already know the product and can ensure quality.
* Forward integration - merge downstream the production cycle
* Backward integration - reduces uncertainty as less likely to have hold ups. However there is higher coordination co

**The Regulation of the Firm**
Markets and the Role of Government - 
Government objectives should be to maximise social welfare, the difference between social benefits and social costs. Governments intervene to correct market failure. Intervene through taxes and subsidies.

Types of market failure -
Public goods like national defence - non-rivalry, non-excludability
Market power like water supply - lack of social efficiency - welfare loss under monopoly
Ignorance and uncertainty by consumers and by firms
Immobility of factors and lag times
Protecting people's interests (e.g. poor people may buy cigarettes instead of food)

Applying taxes aligns the marginal private costs with the marginal social costs. Maximises social welfare.
Tax excess profits, subsidise extra output
Governments can also make changes in property rights, or they can create laws prohibiting behaviour that imposes external costs
Price controls: high minimum prices, low maximum prices

However some people think that the government shouldn't have such an impact. Advantages of a free market: automatic adjustments, always the potential for competition 

Competition policy - consists of government measures aimed at stimulating competition and protection against monopoly - whether or not we allow a bunch of mergers. 
Deregulation, reduction of tariffs

**Economic Analysis in Competition Cases**
Abuse of a dominant position - firm deliberately puts down prices to kill a competing firm - predatory pricing. Deliberate acceptance of losses.

Colluding to keep the price up. Price matching.
Mergers that raise prices should be prevented.

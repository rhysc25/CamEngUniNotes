Very few (10-15%) firms profit, exceed the cost of capital
Michael Porter business strategy key points:

* Operational effectiveness is not strategy
Rapid diffusion of best practice. Benchmarking against other firms leads to copying and lack of distinctiveness
You need to focus on sustainable advantage - be different from other firms

* Strategy rests on unique activities
Customer offerings should rest on capabilities, not marketing slogans. This is called strategic position. Emerges from one or more of:
1) Variety based - scope of activities to secure efficiency - E.g. Primark. Very low cost
2) Needs based - tailored to needs of target customer - E.g. Selfridges
3) Access based - right place at the right time - e.g. car rentals at airport
Avoid straddling between multiple - stuck in the middle with middling costs and middling pricing power
Strategic position should require choice, take priority over growth. Double down on your strategic position. Remain distinctive.

* Sustainable strategic position rests on trade-offs
If your differentiated strategy works, you will be imitated.
Barriers to imitation: 
1) Brand image (e.g. Disney) - in people's hearts and minds
2) Commitments - monetary barrier to entry
3) Tight co-ordination and control - most firms are badly run. Hard to make a well run firm

* Fit drives advantage and sustainability
Types of fit: Simple consistency between activity and strategy - optimisation of effort - reinforcing activities
Over time you are going to be able to add more layers to your business

Porter's five forces:
1) Rivalry among existing competitors
2) Bargaining power of suppliers
3) Threat of substitute products
4) Bargaining power of buyers - power of buyer to set the price - more buyers, less price setting ability
5) Threat of new entrants
The job of a firm is to weaken these forces

In simple plasticity theory, we idealise the stress strain curve for a material as either rigid-perfectly plastic or elastic-perfectly plastic
![[Pasted image 20260123165942.png]]
Assumptions: Neglected work hardening, ductile material so long plastic plateau, the behaviour is identical in tension and compression

Once plastic deformation starts occurring, a plastic hinge forms

At first yield: $M_y = \frac{I}{|y|_{max}}\sigma_y$, where $\frac{I}{|y|_{max}}$ is the elastic section modulus $Z_e$

If we want to consider the fully plastic moment, we have to equate forces in the tensile section and the compressive section, then take moments.
This gives $M_p = \frac{bd^2}{4}\sigma_y$, or $M_p=Z_p\sigma_y$ where $Z_p$ is the plastic section modulus

If instead we consider a rigid-perfectly plastic ideal, it would have no moment until the moment it undergoes plastic deformation, where it has $M_p$.

Finding $Z_p$ -
The area in tension must be equal to the area in compression, so to find the axis of equal area, we just find the line in which there's equal area above and below.

Once we have this line:
$Z_p=\int_{section}|y|dA$
If instead the section is made of many parts, we more commonly use:
$Z_p=\sum A_r |\bar{y}_r|$

**Plastic Collapse for Determinate Beams**

A plastic hinge will normally occur where a point load acts, or where there is a pivot

Setting our scenario up like this, we can see that, due to small angles: $\theta = 2 \delta / L$
Equating our external load to our energy dissipated by the hinge, we can say that:
$W_c \times \delta = M_p \times 2\theta$, giving us an expression for $W_c$ in terms of $M_p$

If there are two possible failure points, we find the one with the smallest $W_c$

If there is a distributed load, we can just consider the average work done of the loading. We must also set the hinge at an arbitrary location $x$ and differentiate our expression for $W_c$ to find the true $W_c$ and position of the plastic hinge

Upper bound theory of plasticity: An estimate of the plastic collapse load with this method will always be greater than or equal to the actual collapse load: $W_{mech}=W_c$
This whole method considers compatibility and material law, but neglects equilibrium. If we instead consider equilibrium and material law, neglecting compatibility, we get the lower bound theorem.

**Plastic collapse of a Statically Indeterminate Beam**
A statically indeterminate beam will require more than one hinge. If we are bending at a built in support, then that adds to the $M_p \theta$ term

If we have a material with fully plastic moment $k M_p$ connected to one with moment $M_p$, and a hinge forms at the intersection, the moment used is the lower of the two.

We can also do the exact same thing but for portal frames, with 3 main failure mechanisms to consider:

For the combined mechanism the angles can be slightly so we use instantaneous centres to find the small displacements and rotations.

We can also draw a graph of $Va/M_p$ against $\frac{Hh}{M_p}$ to find our safe regions

The same can be done with pitched roof portal frames, with these possible combinations:

There are two beam mechanisms, as either of the supports could be pushed out.

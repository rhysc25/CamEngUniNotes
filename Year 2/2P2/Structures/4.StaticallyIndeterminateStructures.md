Statically indeterminate structures do not have a unique solution. 

To determine the number of redundancies/ self stress states in our statically indeterminate structure, i.e a beam that is not strictly required for equilibrium, we use the formula: $s-m=b+r-Dj$
s is the number of self stress states/redundancies, m is the number of mechanisms, b is the number of bars, r is the number of restrictions, D is the dimension, usually 2, and j is the number of joints

Depending on the number of self stress states, remove that number of bars (remove bars that will leave a statically determinate structure behind), then find all forces by equilibrium. This is your particular solution, $\textbf{t}_0$

Next we want to find our self stress states. For this we set the load to zero. Out of our n redundant bars we set 1 to have force 1 in it, the rest 0. Find each of the following stress states, $\textbf{s}_1, ... \textbf{s}_n$

The general equilibrium solution is $\textbf{s}=x_1 \textbf{s}_1 + ... + x_n \textbf{s}_n$

To find the values of the unknown x's, we need to include material law.
The extension of all the bars is summarised in the extension vector $\textbf{e}$

The flexibility matrix $\textbf{F}$ is a diagonal matrix containing the formulas of $L/AE$ for each of the bars
$$\textbf{e}=\textbf{F}\textbf{t}+\textbf{e}_0=\textbf{F}\textbf{t}_0+x_1\textbf{F}\textbf{s}_1+...+x_n\textbf{F}\textbf{s}_n+\textbf{e}_0$$
$\textbf{e}_0$ is any initial extension that may have been present in the structure

Now we need compatibility to find the values of $x_1$ to $x_n$
The easiest way to do this is to consider virtual work. If we consider a self stress state $\textbf{s}_i$ with zero external force

$\textbf{s}_i \cdot \textbf{e}=0$
A different equation can be found for each state of self stress. We just need to solve these simultaneous equations. We can then sub these values in to find $\textbf{t}$ and $\textbf{e}$

**Finding Deflections in the Structure**

We know that $\sum t \cdot e = \sum f \cdot \delta$
We can find any deflection by setting the virtual force applied to 1.
$\delta_{required}=\textbf{t}^*\cdot \textbf{e}$

For an indeterminate structure, there will be a choice of $\textbf{t}$ but each will give the same $\delta_{required}$. I.e. $\delta = \textbf{t}_1 \cdot \textbf{e} = \textbf{t}_2 \cdot \textbf{e}$

**Three Approaches to Beam Deflections**
First off, hogging curvatures are positive, upwards deflections are positive, and clockwise rotations are positive

We used to find $M(x)$, $\kappa(x)$ and then integrated to find $\phi$ and $v$

This can instead be done by virtual work, equating external work to internal work
External work done = $\sum F_i \cdot \delta_i + \sum C_i \cdot \theta_i + \int w(s) \cdot \delta (s)\cdot ds$

For the internal work, we assume all the internal work is done because of beam bending
$M \cdot \delta \theta = M \kappa \delta s$

Therefore the virtual work equation can be written as:
$\sum F_i \cdot \delta_i + \sum C_i \cdot \theta_i + \int w(s) \cdot \delta (s)\cdot ds = \int M(s) \kappa(s) d s$
We can either apply a virtual force, a virtual torque or a virtual distributed load to find the resulting displacement or rotation

**Indeterminate Beam and Frame Structures**

We consider again the classic case for solving an indeterminate beam problem, where we find the two individual displacements and set them equal to each other, as we know the beam is fixed at a point

How do we determine if a beam/structure is determinate: If you remove a single support or add a single pin it will collapse. Some examples: A cantilever, a simply supported beam, a three-pinned arch.

If we add a pin in a straight beam we destroy 1 moment, so remove one redundancy. If at a junction, that's two.
If we remove a support then depending on the type of support (roller, fixed, en castre) then we are removing 1,2, or 3 redundancies
If we cut a beam we are destroying 1 bending moment, 1 shear force and 1 tension so 3 redundancies

It is much better to take this second option, as it allows us to use databook cases.

Once we have added stuff in order to remove redundancies, we then consider equilibrium of all the pieces of our structure separated by the things we added.
If we have removed a bending moment with our addition, we include it in our equilibrium calculations. In this scenario, the thing we are ensuring compatibility for is the slope of the beam.

One of the components can be considered to be the particular solution, and another the state of free stress.

Once we know the internal bending moment M we can work out our shear force and bending moment diagrams

If we instead had a ring structure, where one end was built in, we can replace it with a pin joint and ensure that the rotations at that end in the particular solution and the self stress state sum to 0. This will allow you to find the moment at the built in end.

**Implications of Redundancy**
It is possible to have internal forces within the structure, with no external loading being applied. These may exist because of:
* Settlements of supports
* The structure not fitting before it was assembled/misfit
* Temperature changes
In a determinate structure, the structure can deform to take account of these effects. In an indeterminate structure, the structure cannot freely adjust, so a state of self stress results.

Once again, the way to deal with this is to transform into two determinate structures, and apply compatibility.

**Applications of self-stress**
In a carefully designed system, we can enable part of the structure to be prestressed
* Cable-stiffened deployable structures
* Bicycle wheels
* Prestressed concrete beams
* Tensegrity systems, fabric roofs and balloons. These are pre stressed so become rigid

To a first order approximation we would say that the beams have no length change and no stress. We need it to be pre stressed and pre deformed to be able to calculate it.

**Analysis of Symmetric Structures**
Anything symmetric is preserved by reflection of the structure in its plane of symmetry
Anything antisymmetric is reversed by reflection of the structure in its plane of symmetry

Any load can be split into symmetric and antisymmetric components
A symmetric loading can only cause symmetric deformations
An antisymmetric loading can only cause antisymmetric deformations

If we view an antisymmetric loading from two views

And consider the possible displacements, then we know the actual displacement will be some combination of these

Consider an antisymmetric loading

What if we wanted to cut through the structure and find stresses at an arbitrary angle?
We always find the initial easy state first, where everything is orthogonal with the walls.

From their we can take a smaller element and perform force balances, multiplying the stresses over the areas they are acting on

Nomenclature: $\tau_{xy}$ means its on face x and pointing towards face y

Performing this analysis for a generic case:
$\sigma_{aa}=(\sigma_{xx}\cos(\theta)+\tau_{xy}\sin(\theta))\cos(\theta)+(\sigma_{yy}\sin(\theta)+\tau_{xy}\cos(\theta))\sin(\theta)$
$\tau_{aa}=-\sigma_{xx}\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)+\sigma_{yy}\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)+\tau_{xy}(\cos^2(\theta)-\sin^2(\theta))$
These equations can be found in the data book

**Mohr's Circle of Stress in 2D**

For various angles $\theta$, plot a graph of normal stress on a face against shear stress
For Mohr's circle, shear stress is plotted positive when it is acting clockwise

Diametrically opposite points show the complementary shear stress
This circle repeats with a period of $180\degree$

With a bit of double angle manipulation, we get that:

We can clearly see the rotational matrix appearing and causing the circle nature

Once we've found the radius of the circle, we can simply do $R\cos(2\theta)$ to get the normal stress.

In reality, we should be consider a 3D cube, with $\sigma_l$, $\sigma_h$ and $\sigma_t$, where $\sigma_t$ is zero.
We must draw the actual Mohr's diagram, considering 3 circles with the min/max being 2 of the 3 $\sigma_l, \sigma_h$ or $\sigma_t$
The maximum shear stress is found by rotating around the longitudinal axis by $45\degree$

Note: Only use Mohr's circle to rotate around principle axes, if you try anything else you will lose track of shears on the faces.
Instead we could use a stress tensor.

In terms of strains, it is clear that a shear strain in one direction is the same as a normal strain in another.

It turns out there is a perfect correspondence between the stress and strain equations when we change the angle of an element.
Replace $\sigma_{ii}$ with $\epsilon_{ii}$, and $\tau_{xy}$ with $\frac{\gamma_{xy}}{2}$

**Mohr's Circle of Strain**
Plot half the shear strain against the normal strain. For Mohr's circle of strain, shear strain is plotted positive when the centre of the face has moved in a clockwise direction relative to the centre of the square.

All of the other rules of Mohr's circle apply, including the fact that you can always find the principle axes where only normal strains occur.

Using Mohr's circle we can find $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$, which we can use to find stresses with $\sigma_1=\frac{E}{1-\nu^2}(\epsilon_1+\nu \epsilon_2)$

**Strain Gauges**
A wire changes length as the material it's placed on undergoes strain. The resistance of the wire will change, and we can measure this with a Wheatstone bridge
Strain gauges cannot measure shear strain, so we set up a rosette.

Here, $\epsilon_{xx}=\epsilon_0$, $\epsilon_{yy}=\epsilon_{90}$
We can use the equation $\epsilon_{aa}=\epsilon_{xx}\cos^2(\theta)+\epsilon_{yy}\sin^2(\theta)+\gamma_{xy}\cos(\theta)\sin(\theta)$
Where $\epsilon_{aa}=\epsilon_{45}$

**Yield Criteria**
Y is the uniaxial yield stress of the material, where the material becomes perfectly plastic.
Plastic straining is due to the movement of dislocations driven by shear stresses
Hydrostatic stress never causes yield, as yielding is driven by shear stress

**Tresca Yield Criterion**
A body will yield when the maximum shear stress reaches a critical value
As we have three Mohr's circles, we must consider the largest of these three

$max(|\sigma_1-\sigma_2|,|\sigma_2-\sigma_3|,|\sigma_3-\sigma_1|)=Y$

With $\sigma_3=0$, this looks like the dashed line, with a non zero $\sigma_3$ we just shift it up and to the right by that amount:

**Von Mises Yield Criteria**

A body will yield when the strain energy of distortion reaches a critical value.
The strain energy of distortion is:
$U_D=\frac{1}{12G}[(\sigma_1-\sigma_2)^2+(\sigma_2-\sigma_3)^2+(\sigma_3-\sigma_1)^2]$
Therefore the von Mises yield criteria states that yield will occur when:
$(\sigma_1-\sigma_2)^2+(\sigma_2-\sigma_3)^2+(\sigma_3-\sigma_1)^2=2Y^2$

This looks like:
![[Pasted image 20251119142752.png]]

At (0,$\pm Y$) and $(\pm Y,0)$ both criterion are the same.
The maximum discrepancy is for pure shear ($\sigma_1=-\sigma_2$) where the difference is about 15%

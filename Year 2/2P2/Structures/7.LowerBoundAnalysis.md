Consider equilibrium to determine the collapse load, will give us a lower bound.
If a set of internal stresses can be found in the structure that are in equilibrium with an applied load $W_{equil}$ and nowhere violate the yield condition, then $W_{equil}\leq W_c$

If we find the largest lower bound solution which equals the smallest upper bound solution then we have found the true collapse load.

How to find lower bound: Find the bending moment for the generic indeterminate beam structure, with dummy bending moments $M_1$ and $M_2$ and so on

An optimum solution will have the 2 max bending moments equal to each other, and the magnitude of the minimum moment equal to the magnitude of the maximum moment.

Ensure that no where do we exceed $M_p$
We can also vary the thickness of the beams, look up $Z_p$ in the data book, to mean that we're almost at the full moment capacity of our beams.
Remember $M_p=Z_p \sigma_y$

If instead you are given the $M_p$ for different beam segments and asked to see if it is a safe design, make the internal bending moments as large as possible without violating yield, then check that the resulting moments everywhere else in the beam are suitable.

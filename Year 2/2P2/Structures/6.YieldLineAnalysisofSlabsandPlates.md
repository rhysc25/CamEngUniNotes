We will be extended plastic theory to 2 dimensions
There is new drawing notation to be aware of:

The plastic moment in a rectangular beam is $M_p = Z_p \sigma_y = \frac{bd^2}{4}\sigma_y$
For a plate, we need the moment capacity per unit length $m=\frac{d^2}{4}\sigma_y$
The 1B course will always assume that the value of m is isentropic

Assumptions of yield line theory:
1) Collapse is due to ductile flexural failure
2) In-plane forces are ignored
3) The deformations are small

Compatible yield lines:
1) The yield lines divide the slab into several rigid regions. Each region must have a unique axis about which it rotates.
2) The yield lines must be straight between intersections
3) A yield line between two rigid regions must pass through the intersection of the axis of rotation of those regions
Examples:

**Energy Dissipated**
For a hinge between two rigid regions, i and j, the total plastic moment in the hinge will be $M_p = m l_{ij}$
Where m is the plastic moment per unit length of the slab and l is the length of the hinge
$$\text{total E.D.} = \sum ml_{ij}\theta_{ij}$$
**Work Done**
The work done by a point load is still $W\delta$
The work done by a uniform pressure is $\int p \delta{x,y} dA$
We can instead calculate this with W.D. = $pV$, where V is the volume swept out by the collapsing slab
This is easy as most collapse mechanisms can be split into roof sections and pyramid section.

Draw the rotation lines as vectors. Then set up a vector diagram, to find the values of $\theta_{ij}$, which is the rotation between slabs i and j

Alternatively, we can use the fact that the energy dissipated is equivalent to:$m \times \text{The projected length of yield line onto adjacent axes of rotation} \times  \text{The rotation about the same axes}$
E.g.

Now we will consider the slip plane analysis of continua (blocks)
We shall assume that the material will only fail in shear at a shearing stress k, and is otherwise rigid. The usual assumption holds that the geometry remains essentially unchanged. We will also once again be equating the energy dissipated and the work done.

The work done by the load is still $W\delta$.
The energy dissipated is the Area X The shear stress, k X The relative displacement
The hardest part is finding the relative displacements, for which we use a displacement diagram.

A similar thing can be done with forming processes

This mechanism includes sliding between the anvil and the material and we don't know the properties of this interface. We can consider two limiting situations:
1) Zero friction - no energy dissipated between the interface
2) Infinite friction - material directly next to the anvil will shear as a normal shear plane

**Thin-walled Sections**

Through-thickness stresses are zero everywhere
The stress state is uniform through the section

Stiffeners prevent local buckling and can carry concentrated loads

From 1A: $\sigma_l = \frac{pr}{2t}$ and $\sigma_h = \frac{pr}{t}$

Bellow joints allow expansion of the pipeline:
 $\sigma_l = 0$ at bellows joint

Circumferential stiffeners must reduce the average hoop stress as the area is now greater than $2lt$

But depends on the section we take, we get different values, so hoop stress must vary. 

Longitudinal stiffeners will carry the same load as the skin, and hence the longitudinal stress will be reduced

Considering non-circular cylinders with a vertical axis of symmetry under axial forces, bending moments and shear forces:

Only vertical deflection
Neutral axis at the centroidal level
$\sigma_l = P/A$. $\sigma_l = \frac{My}{I}$

Complementary Shear Stress:
A state of simple shear requires equal shear stress on all four faces of an arbitrary small block

$q = \frac{S\bar{y}A_{S}}{I}$
The shear stress can be found be dividing the shear force by the area of the longitudinal cut

The maximum shear stress will be found with the minimum area, so the cut should be perpendicular to the wall

Stiffeners will increase A and I, reducing stress due to axial loads and reducing the stress due to bending
As it increases both A and I, it will negligible effect on the shear stresses due to shear-loading

To avoid the full complications of calculating exact section properties including stiffeners, the
stiffeners are often ‘smeared’ out by making the thin walls a little thicker.

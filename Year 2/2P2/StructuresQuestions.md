**Thin Walled Sections**

What effect do stiffeners have on both longitudinal stresses and shear stresses?

Where is the largest shear stress for a general structure?

Will a shear stress ever cause normal strain?

How do you calculate the change in radius by the hoop strain?

How do we calculate the volumetric strain?

**Torsion**

What is the shear flow q, and how does it change around a thin walled section?

Why does this analysis only work for closed sections?

How do stiffeners effect q?

What is the torsional rigidity/stiffness?

Why is a circular sectional optimal for torsional stiffness?

**Analysis of Stresses and Strains**

What are the axes of a Mohr's circle of stress and what's important about the direction of shear stress?

What is the period of Mohr's circle?

Why can we only use Mohr's circle to rotate around the principle axes?

What are the axes of a Mohr's circle of strain and what's important about the direction of shear strain?

How can we use strain gauges to measure shear stress?

Why does hydrostatic loading never cause yielding?

What do both the von Mises and Tresca yield criterion look like when plotting on axes of $\sigma_2$ against $\sigma_1$?

When do we see the largest discrepancy between the two yield criteria?

How do we change the graphs when we have a non-zero value of $\sigma_3$?

**Statically Indeterminate Structures**

What is the number of redundancies in a structure equal to, and how do we calculate it?

Explain the process of finding bar tensions in an indeterminate beam structure

How do we then find displacements at specific nodes?

How do we use virtual work in a beam to find either a deflection or rotation?

How do we remove redundancies from our beams and what do we have to ensure we put back after this action?

If in the structure one of the bars was initially too short, what would $\textbf{e}_0$ look like?

What must be true about the deflection and the bending moment in the midpoint of an antisymmetrically loaded structure?

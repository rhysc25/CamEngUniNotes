Fourier transforms generalise to non-periodic signals
The general principle is to take a slice of the signal and repeat it, as though it was periodic. This will give a frequency spectrum. We then vary T, increasing to infinity, until the frequency spectrum is more like a smooth function (or delta functions).

As $T\rightarrow \infty$, we obtain a component at every frequency $\omega$

We define a function $D_T(\omega)$ which equals $Tc_n$ at $\omega = n\omega_0$
$D_T(\omega)=\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}f(t)e^{-j\omega t}dt$
We do not average over T so that we have a meaningful limit
The Fourier transform is defined as this as $T\rightarrow \infty$
$$F(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-j\omega t}dt$$
This produces components for all frequencies
The Fourier transform decomposes a signal into an integral of sinusoids, and $F(\omega)$ provides the weights of these components

**The Inverse Fourier Transform**
From $F(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t')e^{-j\omega t'}dt'$
Multiply both sides by $e^{j\omega t}$ and integrate over $\omega$
$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)d\omega=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t')e^{-j\omega t'}e^{j\omega t}dt'd\omega$
Switch the summation around, giving:
$I=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t')\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{j\omega (t - t')}d\omega dt'$
This gives that:
$I=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t') 2\pi \delta(t-t') dt'=2\pi f(t)$
Therefore, the inverse Fourier transform is:
$$f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)e^{j\omega t}d\omega$$
Important Fourier Transforms:

* If $f(t)=e^{j\omega_0 t} \Rightarrow \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-j(\omega - \omega_0)t}dt = 2\pi \delta(\omega - \omega_0)$
* For sinusoids, convert to complex exponential form then do superposition of Fourier transforms, as they are linear.
* If $f(t)=a\delta(t)$, by the sifting property, $F(\omega)=a$. This is a constant for all frequencies.
A signal cannot be well localised in both time and frequency

This course is all about determining the frequency components of data.

Nyquist sampling theorem - Shows it is possible to reconstruct an original analogue signal perfectly from correctly digitised data

Energy - How much total signal is present
Power - How much signal content is present on average

The total energy of a signal $f(t)$: $E_f=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|f(t)|^2dt$
Often more convenient to compute as a limit: 
$E_f=\lim_{T\rightarrow \infty}\int_{-T/2}^{+T/2}|f(t)|^2dt$

Average power estimated over the whole time interval:
$P_f=\lim_{T\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{+T/2}|f(t)|^2dt$

For a decaying signal, energy is well defined but power goes to zero, so we call it an energy signal
For a constant signal, energy is infinite but power is well defined, so we call it a power signal
For a signal with unbounded growth, energy is infinite and power is undefined

Delta functions are key to signal analysis. Infinitely narrow and infinitely tall, with an area of 1 under the spike.

Ideal sampling tool, picking out the value of a function at a specific point.
Sifting property:
$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(t) \delta (t-a)dt=g(a)$

Other functions in their limit become the delta function. For example if we consider $sinc(t)$, that is $\frac{\sin(t)}{t}$.
$\frac{\sin(at)}{\pi t}$ becomes the delta function as $a \rightarrow \infty$

In a Fourier series, each term has the form $e^{jn\omega_0 t}$
If we sum over all frequencies, we get this integral

$I=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp(j\omega t)d\omega=\lim_{A\rightarrow \infty}\int_{-A}^{A} \exp(j\omega t)d\omega$

Standard integration gives $\lim_{A\rightarrow \infty}(a\frac{\sin(At)}{t})$
Which is $2\pi \delta(t)$

This turns on oscillating function into a generalised delta function at the limit:
$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp(j\omega t)d\omega=2\pi \delta(t)$
* Integrating all complex exponentials over frequency produces a time-domain impulse. This will reappear when we generalise Fourier series to non-periodic signals

Any signal can be broken up into discrete frequency components
**Extracting One Fourier Coefficient $c_m$**
1) Fix the index
2) Multiply both sides by $e^{-jm\omega_0 t}$
3) Integrate over one full period

$\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}c_n e^{j(n-m)t} dt = \sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} c_n \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{j(n-m)t} dt$
$\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{j(n-m)t} dt$ is $2\pi$ if $n=m$, 0 otherwise

Therefore:
$$c_m = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}g(t)e^{-jmt\omega_0}dt$$
This idea survives beyond periodic signals. This procedure becomes the Fourier transform when period becomes larger.

When $g(t)$ is real valued, i.e. a real signal: 
$2c_n = a_n - j b_n\qquad 2c_n^* = a_n + j b_n$
$a_n = c_n + c_n^* \qquad \frac{1}{j} (c_n^* - c_n)$

This shows conjugate symmetry, so negative frequencies do not contain new information: $c_{-n}=c_n^*$

The amplitude of the nth harmonic: $2|c_n|=\sqrt{a_n^2+b_n^2}$

**Scaling, stretching and shifting**
* Scaling the amplitude be a factor of a
* Shifting it along the axis by b
* Changing the period to $T'=\beta T$
$g'(t)=ag(\frac{t-b}{\beta})$
The new coefficients are: $c_n' = ac_n e^{-j\omega'_0 nb} \qquad \omega'_0 = \omega_0 / \beta$

**Differentiation**
After differentiating the Fourier series, the new coefficients are $c_n'=jn\omega_0c_n$
Higher frequency components are amplified more, the DC term becomes 0. So acts like a high pass filter.
**Integration**
If we integrate we will get a $c_0 t$ term which is a ramp function. Therefore the function after being integrated can only be periodic if the original function had $c_0 = 0$
After integration, the new constant just depends on the new mean of the function over a period

**Discrete Frequency Spectrum of a Periodic Signal**

The height corresponds to the magnitude of the frequency component

Each harmonic has size $r_n = \sqrt{a_n^2+b_n^2} = 2|c_n|$, but $r_0=c_0$

**Parseval's Theorem for Fourier Series**
These amplitudes are related to the power content of the signal $g(t)$ over one period
$\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T |g(t)|^2dt=\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}|c_n|^2$
* This shoes that the power or energy of a signal in the time domain is equal to the energy in the frequency domain, ensuring no loss of information
* It provides insight into how the energy of a signal is distributed across its frequency components

If we want to consider how a filter affects different frequency components, we must first find the frequency response of the filter, $H(j\omega)=H(s)|_{s=j\omega}$. The amplitude of the nth harmonic at output is $2|c_n| \times |H(jn\omega_0)|$
A linear system transforms a sinusoid as such:
$|H(j\omega)|\sin(\omega t + \theta + \angle(H(j\omega)))$

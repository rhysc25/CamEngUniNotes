Communication: Process of delivering information from source to destination through a communication channel

Multiple access channel: Multiple sources to one destination
Broadcast channel: One source to multiple destinations

Transmitter: translates information into a suitable signal
Channel: Medium used to transmit signal
Receiver: reconstructs the information from the received signal

Important properties of signals for communication:
1. Power
2. Bandwidth

**Signal Energy**
The energy of a signal $x(t)$ is defined as:
$E_x=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x(t)|^2dt$
Squaring magnitude gives instantaneous power or something analogous

If $X(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of $x(t)$, from Parseval's theorem we know that:
$E_x=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x(t)|^2dt=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|X(\omega)|^2d\omega=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|X(\omega)|^2df$

$|X(f)|^2$ is the energy spectral density.
We can this of $|X(f)|^2df$ as the energy of the signal in the frequency band $[f,f+df]$

**Signal Power**
For a signal $x(t)$ whose energy is infinite, the power is defined as:
$P_x=\lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}|x(t)|^2dt$

Signal power is important because:
* We usually care about transmit power, the energy of the transmitted signal per unit time
* Lower transmit power means longer battery life
* Lower transmit power also makes signal harder to detect at the receiver in the presence of noise
* Need clever Tx + Rx designs that make judicious use of available transmit power

**Bandwidth**
The bandwidth of a signal is roughly the range of frequencies over which its spectrum (Fourier transform) is non-zero

Fourier Transforming the signal: $X(f)=\int x(t)e^{-j2\pi ft}dt$
Similarly: $X^*(f)=\int x^*(t)e^{j2\pi ft}dt$
From this we can see that is $x(t)$ is real, then $X^*(f)=X(-f)$

**Baseband**

For real signals, bandwidth measured as the range of positive frequencies as $|X(f)|$ is symmetric around 0. Specified in Hz

A signal is called low-pass or baseband if its spectral content is centred around $f=0$.
The bandwidth of the baseband signal above is W

**Passband**
![[Passband.png]]
A signal is said to be passband if its spectral content is centred around $\pm f_c$, where $f_c >> 0$
The bandwidth of this passband signal is 2W

**Pitfall**
If we consider a rectangular pulse and perform a Fourier transform on it, we get that $X(f)=T\sin(\pi fT)$
This would make the bandwidth $\infty$

Many real-word signals are time-limited. These will not be strictly limited in frequency.

Other, more practical, definitions of bandwidth:
* $90\%$ bandwidth: The range of frequencies which contain $90\%$ of the energy of the spectrum
* 3-dB bandwidth: The range of frequencies which contain $50\%$ of the energy of the spectrum
* Null-to-null bandwidth: The width of the main lobe of the spectrum for the rect signal

Thus bandwidth is a measure of the extent of significant spectral content of the signal

Wireless bandwidth is licensed and regulated by OFCOM and a company has to buy a slice of the spectrum, say a few tens of MHz

Wired channels act like linear systems or filters: Their transfer function is roughly flat over a band of frequencies $[-W,W]$ around 0, then attenuated to 0 for higher frequencies

A channel introduces attenuation and noise, which can cause errors at the receiver

**Modelling Channels**

Channels are often modelled as linear systems with additive noise:
Channel output $y(t)$ generated from input $x(t)$ as: 

$y(t)=h(t) \times x(t) + n(t)$

In frequency domain:
$Y(f)=H(f)X(f) + N(f)$
![[FrequencyResponseOfTelephoneCable.png]]

If the input is restricted to the band where the channel $H(f)$ is flat, then the channel is: $Y(f)=X(f)+N(f)$
or: $y(t)=x(t)+n(t)$

$n(t)$ is the thermal noise at the Rx:
Generated by the thermal agitation of electrons inside an electrical conductor
Happens regardless of the applied voltage

**Gaussian modelling of thermal noise**
Thermal noise $n(t)$ is modelled as a Gaussian random process:
* At each time t, $n(t)$ is a Gaussian random variable
* A rigorous description requires knowledge of random processes

We want the rate of energy transfer. This is different from normal thermodynamics which is largely focussed on equilibrium states.
3 mechanisms of heat transfer:
1) Conduction - transfer my molecular vibration
2) Convection - transfer by bulk motion
3) Radiation - transfer by EM waves

**Conductive Heat Transfer**
heat flux $\dot{q}=\frac{\dot{Q}}{A}\propto \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}$
The constant of proportionality $\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity in $W/mK$
Fourier's law: $$\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} = - \lambda \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}$$
If we consider one dimensional steady heat flow: As there can be no accumulation of energy: $\frac{d}{dx}(\dot{q}_x)=0$.
Subbing in Fourier's law we can clearly see that the temperature gradient is constant, giving:
$\dot{Q}=A\lambda \frac{(T_1 - T_2)}{l}$

We define the thermal resistance as $R_{th}=\frac{l}{\lambda A}$
$V=IR$ and $\Delta T = \dot{Q} R_{th}$ are perfectly analogous
Heat transfer resistances in series add, just like normal resistors!

If instead we have heat transfer from a solid surface to a flowing fluid we have: $$\dot{Q}=hA(T_{wall}-T_{\infty})$$
In this case it is clear that $R_{th}= \frac{1}{hA}$ for this scenario

If we have a cylinder we can put A as $2\pi r l$ and then integrate to find an expression for $\dot{Q}$ which is constant
It can be shown that adding insulating material to a pipe initially has a negative effect, encouraging heat loss, until enough insulation is added.

**Unsteady Heat Conduction**
Allow energy to accumulate within the volume. We will also consider the case where the heat is generated internally (ohmic heating for example). The internal heat generation is $G (W/m^3)$

The net energy input to the element must equal the change in internal energy of the element
$\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial q_x}{\partial x}+G$
$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\frac{\lambda}{\rho c}\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}+\frac{G}{\rho c}$
$\frac{\lambda}{\rho c}=\alpha$ is called the thermal diffusivity $(m^2/s)$

In the absence of internal heat generation we just have the 1D transient heat diffusion equation

Example: conduction in a semi-infinite slab
Characteristic length: $\frac{x}{\sqrt{\alpha t}}$. $t=\frac{x^2}{\alpha}$. A characteristic time for heat diffusion is $s^2/\alpha$ where s is a characteristic dimension of the body (most likely volume/surface area)
You can get to this result by non dimensionalising the equation (say $x=x'L$), then saying any derivative that is $\frac{dx'}{dy'}$ or similar has order 1. Scaling analysis.

Another non-dimensional group that is useful in transient heat conduction problems is the Fourier number $Fo$
$F_O = \frac{\text{time}, \tau}{\text{characteristic time for heat diffusion through the body}}=\frac{\alpha \tau}{s^2}$
A body can considered to have heated up when $F_O> 1$

Lumped heat capacity analysis - 
In many situations, a transient heat transfer situation involves a solid (with relatively low internal thermal resistance) and a solid/fluid interface with a relatively high thermal resistance. Because of this, we can assume that the solid body is at uniform temperature.
$c\rho V\frac{dT}{dt}=-\dot{Q}=hA(T-T_{\infty})$
The solution for this with adequate initial conditions is: $\frac{T-T_{\infty}}{T_0-T_{\infty}}=exp(-\frac{t}{\tau_c})$ where $\tau_c=c\rho V/hA$

This has a clear analogy with a first order electrical RC network. It is a linear RC circuit with $R=1/hA$ and $C=\rho c V$
When is this model valid?
internal thermal resistance / surface thermal resistance = $\frac{\frac{s}{\lambda A}}{\frac{1}{hA}}=\frac{hs}{\lambda}<<1$
This is the Biot number Bi. It should be less than 0.1 really.

**Heat Exchangers**
Here is a diagram of a shell and tube heat exchanger -

Hot fluid through tubes, cooled by cold fluid in the shell
We want to find the heat exchanged, which is a very similar problem to the cylinder example. 
For heat exchangers we use U values, where $\dot{Q}=UA\Delta T$. U is the overall heat transfer coefficient.
$UA = \frac{1}{R_{total}}$
We have to declare which surface the heat transfer coefficient is for, i.e. inner or outer
$U_1A_1=U_2A_2=1/R_{total}$

Assume they are co-flow - travelling in the same direction
![[Pasted image 20260210132140.png]]
They get infinitely close but don't touch, as that would require an infinite heat exchanger
The x axis has A on it, which is proportional to x, as area covered = $2\pi r x$
3 equations:
dQ lost from hot stream
dQ gained from cold stream
Heat transfer locally: $d\dot{Q}=UA(dT_{h}-dT_c)$
Integrate down the heat exchanger, taking into account temperature change

$dT_h=\frac{-d\dot{Q}}{\dot{m}hc_h}$, $dT_h=\frac{-d\dot{Q}}{\dot{m}hc_h}$, and $d\dot{Q}=UA(dT_{h}-dT_c)$
Combining these three gives the equation: $$\ln(\frac{T_{h2}-T_{c2}}{T_{h1}-T_{c1}})=-UA(\frac{1}{\dot{m}_hc_h}+\frac{1}{\dot{m}_cc_c})$$
We call $\dot{m}c$ the heat capacity flow
From this we can get the equation: $\dot{Q}=UA(\frac{(T_{h2}-T_{c2})-(T_{h1}-T_{c1})}{\ln[(T_{h2}-T_{c2})/(T_{h1}-T_{c1})]})$
This can be written as $\dot{Q}=UA\Delta T_m$ and $T_m=\frac{\Delta T_2 - \Delta T_1}{\ln(\frac{\Delta T_2}{\Delta T_1})}$ = the log mean temperature difference
This also applies to counter-flow heat exchangers too.

Co flow is a bad strategy as if we plot it on a $T-Q$(cumulative) graph we see a pinch point. The temperature of the cold fluid is only ever heated to this average amount, with an infinitely long heat exchanger.
![[Pasted image 20260212170723.png]]

Instead we use counter flow 
![[Pasted image 20260212170814.png]]
If we have an infinitely long heat exchanger, the cold stream can approach the inlet hot fluid temperature or the hot stream can approach the inlet temperature of the cold fluid. It depends on which stream has the lowest $\dot{m}c$, as the gradient is equal to $1/\dot{m}c$
The lower temperature difference in the counter flow heat exchanger means that irreversibilities are reduced so more heat can be transferred. Maximum heat transfer when infinite heat transfer area, $\Delta T_{lm}=0$.

The effectiveness $\epsilon$ of a HX is defined as the actual heat exchange over the maximum possible (achieved in counter flow mode). $\epsilon = \frac{\dot{m}_c c_h (T_{hin}-T_{hout})}{(\dot{m}c)_{min})(T_{hin}-T_{cin})}$

We have already used a convective boundary condition. $\Delta T = T_{\infty} - T_w$
The heat transfer coefficient h is given by $\dot{q}=-h\Delta T$
h may vary with position, so we tend to use $\frac{\dot{Q}}{A}=-\dot{h}_{av}\Delta T_{mean}$
Often we will want the average heat transfer coefficient and the fluid mechanics will be too complicated to allow us to calculate the local value

There are two types of convection:
1) Forced convection - when the fluid is driven over the surface e.g. by a fan or a pump
2) Free (natural) convection - when density differences due to buoyancy drive the flow

Navier stokes describe the mechanical energy field and this influences the thermal energy field. If the density is not constant, then the thermal energy field will influence the mechanical energy field, so the calculation requires feedback.

We can assume the fluid is incompressible if the Mach number is less than about 0.3
Therefore: $\dot{Q}=m_{in}c_pT - m_{out}c_pT$
The properties of a fluid depend on temperature. Very often the properties are assumed to take the values at the mean value of the temperature, the film temperature
$T_{film}=(T_w+T_{\infty})/2$, the average of the wall and the free stream velocity

It turns out momentum exchange and heat exchange are very similar, with almost identical equations. $\tau = \mu \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial y}$, $\dot{q}=-\lambda \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}$
For momentum transfer we have the momentum diffusivity $\nu$, an for heat transfer we have the thermal diffusivity $\alpha$. 

The ratio $\nu / \alpha$ is the Prandtl number (Pr)
If this number is close to one then momentum and heat transfer in the exact same way

New non-dimensional heat transfer coefficients:

* Nusselt (Nu) number: $\frac{\dot{q}}{\dot{q}_{no flow}}=\frac{hD}{\lambda}$ 
This is the heat flow normalised by conductive heat flux with no flow

* Stanton (St) number: $\frac{h}{\rho c_p v}$ 
This is the heat flow normalised by the characteristic convection heat flow

Reynold's analogy - Prandtl number = 1
The momentum diffusivity = the thermal diffusivity. The equations governing them are identical

As the enthalpy needs a reference value, $h=h^{\theta}+c_p(T-T^{\theta})$, we can say that the enthalpy is zero as the wall, hence $h=c_p(T-T_w)$

If we let $\theta=\frac{T-T_w}{T_{\infty}-T_w}$ and $v'=\frac{v_x}{V}$, and Pr = 1, then the equations are the exact same considering mass and momentum transfer in and just outside the boundary layer.
$\frac{T-T_w}{T_{\infty}-T_w}=\frac{v_x}{V}$. They also have the same boundary conditions, 0 at 0, and a y asymptote at 1.

With some algebra we also find that: $$St = \frac{1}{2}c_f$$
They have the same underlying mechanics. if we want to increase the heat transfer coefficient we have to increase the shear stress too.

If Pr not 1, then the thermal and momentum boundary layers will be different sizes.
If Pr << 1: $\delta_{mom}<<\delta_{therm}$
From experimental results: $St = \frac{1}{2}C_fPr^{-2/3}$
If we differentiate our approximation for the velocity profile of the boundary layer, we get $\tau_w=\mu\frac{3V}{2\delta}$
We get that the local friction coefficient, $C_{fx}=\mu\frac{3}{2\rho V \delta}$

Performing non-dimensionalisation on our different transfer coefficients, we get: $$Nu=f(Re,Pr)$$
**Natural Convection**
Results in smaller heat transfer
When heated, fluids expand and are driven upwards by buoyancy forces

For small density changes:
$\delta rho \approx -\bar{\rho}\beta \delta T$

For a liquid, $\beta$ must be obtained from a table
For a perfect gas: $\beta=\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is some average temperature

Governing equation for convective flow near a hot plate: Boussinesq Equation:
$\rho V\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}=\bar{\rho}\beta (T-T_{\infty})g+\mu\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial y^2}$
We want to do a scaling analysis to find an estimate for V. We can say that velocities are quite small so the $\rho V\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}$ term is 0. From the rest being of equal magnitude, we get that:
$V~\frac{\beta \bar{\rho}g\Delta T\delta^2}{\mu}$
As we typically don't know $\delta$, we can use D instead, where D is the characteristic length of the problem

When talking about natural convection, we need a quantity to use instead of the Reynolds number. We use the Grashof Number (Gr)
$$Gr=\frac{\bar{\rho}V_{scale}D}{\mu}=\frac{\bar{\rho}^2\beta g \Delta T D^3}{\mu^2}=\frac{\beta g \Delta T D^3}{\nu^2}$$
Where $\nu=\mu/\rho$
Note -
* The flows are all laminar as velocities in natural convection are small
* The boundary layer does not separate, as no pressure gradients
For natural convection, $Nu=f(Gr,Pr)$

**Laminar Boundary Layers**

The boundary layer is a region in the flow where viscosity matters, where it otherwise shouldn't
If we consider the Reynold's number, $\frac{\rho V D}{\mu}$. In the boundary layer, this characteristic length is more like the height of the boundary layer, i.e. $\delta$, which is very small. This means that in the boundary layer, viscous forces play a much bigger role than otherwise.

Using dimensional analysis on the continuity equation, and the momentum equations in x and y, we find that:
* $V_y\approx \frac{\delta}{x}V$, so very small
* $\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} \approx 0$, so a given cross section of the boundary layer will have constant pressure
* $\delta^2 \approx \frac{\mu x}{\rho V}$, so the boundary layer heigh changes with $\sqrt{x}$

As shown before, flow experiencing an unfavourable pressure gradient can reverse close to the wall, if the pressure gradient is large enough.
If flow moving forward interacts with flow moving backwards, we get a separation point, where flow loses contact with the surface

**Delaying Boundary Layer Separation**
* We want more viscous flow - lower the Reynold's number. Momentum diffuses more efficiently into the boundary layer, which can then withstand the adverse pressure gradient longer.
* We can also reenergise the flow by injecting high-momentum fluid into it to counteract flow reversal
* Suck the low momentum part of the boundary layer into the wing - requires a large amount of power

**Turbulent Boundary Layers**

From above, $\delta^2 \approx \frac{\mu x}{\rho V}$. Therefore $\frac{\delta}{x} \approx \frac{\mu }{\rho V x}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{Re_x}}$
Considering fluid encapsulated by the streamline closest to the boundary layer:

Balancing momentum:
$-\int_0^x \tau_w dx = \int_0^{\delta} \rho v v dy - \rho vv h$
To find h, balance mass flow
$\int_0^h \rho v dy = \rho v h$
Therefore we have $\int_0^x \tau_w dx = V\int_0^{\delta}\rho v dy - \int_0^{\delta} \rho v^2 dy$
Using an approximate laminar boundary layer profile with this formula will usually give you an exact expression for $\frac{\delta}{x}$. It gives the constant of proportionality, in terms of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{Re_x}}$

As $Re_x$ increases along the flow, viscous forces become weak so flow breaks down into small, disorganised eddies, giving turbulence

Turbulence causes the boundary layer size to increase rapidly

**Turbulence delays the flow separation**
The momentum eddy diffusion makes the profile fuller, as it increases momentum transfer from the free stream. This means the flow is more robust against flow reversal to separation is delayed.

This decreases the region of low p behind an object, reducing drag, so with flying objects we want to induce turbulence early.

Alternatively:
Once a laminar flow has separated, the inflection point is very prone to instability, so it can become turbulent, then reattach.

**External Flows and Drag**
$C_{lift}=\frac{\text{Lift}}{1/2 \rho V^2 A}$
$C_{drag}=\frac{\text{Drag}}{1/2 \rho V^2 A}$ 
A = representative area
If the flow is incompressible (low Mach number), then the lift and drag coefficients are functions of the shape of the object, its surface roughness, then angle of attack and the Reynold's number.

A bluff or round body suffers from lower skin friction but higher form drag, as the streamlines separate and a low pressure region forms behind it
A more streamlined body experiences higher skin friction and lower form drag

**Flows at very low Reynolds number ($Re<<1$)**
The flow is perfectly attached and does not separate, so no form drag. The velocity increases with distance from the surface so the whole flow looks like a very thick boundary layer.
This is called Stokes flow: $0 = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \textbf{v}$. Viscous terms dominate over inertial ones.
$$C_D=\frac{24}{Re_D}$$
Very different from inviscid flows, as they satisfy no-slip at solid surfaces. Stokes flow only exists at very small length scales, or very viscous flows.

**Flows at moderately low Reynolds number ($Re \approx 10-100$)**
The boundary layer separates just behind the shoulder.
The pressure in the re-circulating region is approximately the same as that at the point of separation, and is lower than the pressure at the front of the object, hence form drag.

On this graph you can see the deviation in actual $C_D$ compared to what it would have been if it was purely viscous drag. Form drag starts to dominate.

**Flows at moderately high Reynolds number ($Re \approx 10^3-10^5$)**
Form drag dominates, skin friction negligible. The point of separation is very near the shoulder. Drag coefficient remains relatively constant.

**Flows at very high Reynolds number ($Re \geq 10^6$)**
The boundary layer becomes turbulent before it reaches the shoulder. Turbulence in boundary layer increases transport of momentum and delays separation. This reduces the wake and there is a sudden drop in the drag coefficient.

Inviscid models only work when the boundary layers are thin and closely attached to the solid surfaces. They only work in regions where the pressure gradients are favourable or nearly zero.

**Drag reduction - Streamlining**
Skin friction drag ~ surface area $\times \mu \frac{V}{\delta}$
Form drag ~ wake area $\times \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2$

Streamlining increases friction drag which is only influential at low Reynolds number. It is a better option at higher Reynolds number when form drag dominates.

To reduce drag we can also:
* Inject high momentum air into the boundary layer
* Drain away the layer of slow moving air at the bottom of the boundary layer using suction (needs a lot of power)
* Trigger turbulence in the boundary layer by roughening the surface of the body. Increases skin friction but decreases form drag.

We can also generate resonance if oscillating either side of the big drag drop off.

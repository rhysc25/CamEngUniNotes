The boundary layer is a region in the flow where viscosity matters, where it otherwise shouldn't
If we consider the Reynold's number, $\frac{\rho V D}{\mu}$. In the boundary layer, this characteristic length is more like the height of the boundary layer, i.e. $\delta$, which is very small. This means that in the boundary layer, viscous forces play a much bigger role than otherwise.

Using dimensional analysis on the continuity equation, and the momentum equations in x and y, we find that:
* $V_y\approx \frac{\delta}{x}V$, so very small
* $\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} \approx 0$, so a given cross section of the boundary layer will have constant pressure
* $\delta^2 \approx \frac{\mu x}{\rho V}$, so the boundary layer heigh changes with $\sqrt{x}$

As shown before, flow experiencing an unfavourable pressure gradient can reverse close to the wall, if the pressure gradient is large enough.
If flow moving forward interacts with flow moving backwards, we get a separation point, where flow loses contact with the surface

**Delaying Boundary Layer Separation**
* We want more viscous flow - lower the Reynold's number. Momentum diffuses more efficiently into the boundary layer, which can then withstand the adverse pressure gradient longer.
* We can also reenergise the flow by injecting high-momentum fluid into it to counteract flow reversal
* Suck the low momentum part of the boundary layer into the wing - requires a large amount of power

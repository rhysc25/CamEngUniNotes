If we assume a high Reynold's number we can say that the velocity profile is roughly uniform

We track the total pressure $p_T = p + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g h$, also called the mechanical energy per unit volume

Static pressure $p$
Dynamic pressure $\frac{1}{2} \rho v^2$
Stagnation pressure $p+ \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2$
Total pressure $p + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g h$

The head is just the height of liquid that this pressure causes. It could be a difference in pressure also, using a manometer. Total head = $p + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g h / \rho_l g$

The rate of change of total pressure in a pipe is $\frac{dP}{dx}=-\frac{4}{D}c_f (\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2)$
Using this, we can find that the change in total pressure along a pipe of length L is:
$$-\frac{4l}{D} c_f (\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2)$$
The loss of total pressure at a pipe discharge can be worked out with the SFME and the continuity equation, remembering that straight and parallel streamlines means a constant pressure perpendicularly.

The loss of total pressure across an orifice plate can be found by using Bernoulli's equation, then by using the same method as before.

It can be shown that in all these cases the loss of total pressure is given by some constant K times the dynamic pressure.
$$K \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2$$
If we have a pump which supplied energy to the network, we have this equation:
$\frac{\dot{m}}{\rho}(p_{T2}-p_{T1})+(\text{irreversibility losses})=-\dot{W}_x$

Remember that v may change throughout the network if the diameter of the pipe changes.

**Introduction**

What is viscosity?

Can a viscous fluid support shear in static equilibrium?

What is the shear stress at the interface with an inviscid fluid?

Considering density to be constant, what does the law of conservation look like in terms of vector calculus notation?

Why do straight streamlines not imply zero vorticity?

When vorticity is zero, what is special about our application of Bernoulli's principle?

Explain what advection is and how it's represented in vector calculus notation?

**Vector Calculus for Fluids**

Explain how the substantive derivative is different to the derivative following a particle.

Explain how the $-\rho g \textbf{e}_z$ force on a particle can be written as $-\nabla \rho g z$

**Viscous Flow**

When do we have a shear force present, and what is the equation for shear force?

Considering viscous flow between parallel plates, why is $v_x$ a function of y only?

How can we deduce from this that pressure is a function of x only?

What are the two main types of flow through parallel plates and how are they characterised?

If our fluid is moving down a slope, what do we have to take into account in our pressure term?

How can Couette flow and Poiseuille flow be combined?

**Dimensional Analysis**

Explain the Buckingham Pi theorem.

Explain how we would non-dimensionalise an equation.

How do we perform order of magnitude analysis using an equation?

What does order of magnitude analysis tell us about the meaning behind the Reynold's number?

What's our best bet for a dimensionless quantity when we have viscous friction?

If we are told that our function of dimensionless quantities can actually be broken down into the sum of two functions of dimensionless quantities, how do we deal with this?

**Pipe Flow**

Define the bulk velocity of a fluid in a pipe.

Explain what the development region and the fully developed regions are in pipe flow.

Why do eddies decrease in size as velocity increases?

Are eddies better or worse at exchanging momentum about a fluid?

What does a graph of $\log(c_f)$ against $\log(Re)$ look like and why?

As roughness increases, what happens to the friction?

What dimensionless quantity can we use to characterise roughness?

Why does $\log(c_f)$ eventually plateau, even with increasing Re?

Every thermodynamic device relies on a working substance, usually a fluid whose function is to provide a medium for the transfer of heat and work

The air-standard cycles such as the Joule cycle using an ideal gas like air do not approach Carnot as Q not at constant T. However other working fluids can be used which behave more like this so closer to the ideal

Revision:
Properties at a particular state have one value
A state is the condition of a system as described by its properties
A pure substance has a homogeneous and invariable composition
Phases are solid, liquid, vapour

Each working fluid in this course will be considered to be:
A pure substance
One, two or more different phases

State principal: In the absence of external effects, the state of a pure substance is fixed by the values of 2 independent properties

As p=f(T,v), we should be able to experimentally determine p-v-T surfaces, graphs of 3 variables

* Saturation state: A state at which phase change starts and ends
* Vapour dome: The region composed of the two-phase liquid-vapour states (where the fluid can be both at the same time). The saturated liquid and vapour lines are the lines bordering the vapour dome
* Critical point: The point where the saturated liquid and vapour lines meet. Only gas exists at temperatures higher. The critical temperature of a pure substance is the maximum temperature at which liquid and vapour phases can coexist. The isotherm running through this point is the critical isotherm
* If a substance at normal temperatures and pressures lies above its own critical isotherm it is called a gas, otherwise it is a vapour
The triple line is the line along which three phases can exist together

The temperature at which a phase change takes place for a given pressure is called the saturation temperature
The solid-vapour and liquid-vapour regions are separated by the triple point line. They are also separated from the single-phase regions by the saturation lines. 

The difference between the temperature of a superheated vapour (at a temp higher than its boiling point) and the saturation temperature at the same pressure is called the degree of superheat.

**Phase Changes**

Liquid -> vapour: vaporisation
Solid -> liquid: melting
Solid -> vapour: sublimation

During a phase change both phases can coexist
Accompanied by absorption or release of energy resulting from breaking or reformation of intermolecular bonds

During phase change p and T are not independent properties

Heat transferred in a phase change: latent heat. This is a function of p or T

A p-T diagram is known as a phase diagram. Al three phases are separated by lines
The vapourisation line ends at the critical point as no distinction can be made between vapour or liquid. You just have supercritical fluid, which has properties of both a liquid and a gas

Ideal gas assumptions:
* Molecules are rigid, no momentum or time lost during collisions (satisfied by all gases, or else pressure would drop over time)
* Volume occupied by molecules negligible compared to total volume (satisfied at low pressures, sufficiently far apart)
* Forces between adjacent molecules are negligible (satisfied at high pressures and/or low temps)

$\lim_{p\rightarrow 0}\frac{p\overline{v}}{T}=\overline{R}$ for all gases and all temperatures
Where $\overline{R}$ is the universal gas constant, $\approx 8.312kJ/kmol\cdot K$

The compressibility factor, Z, or a gas is $Z=\frac{p\overline{v}}{\overline{R}T}=\frac{pv}{RT}$
As pressure tends to zero, the gas acts ideal, p and v act inversely and Z tends to 1
As the pressure is raised, the interactions become significant and Z diverges from 1

Reduced pressure, $P_R$ = pressure / critical pressure
Reduced temperature, $T_R$ = temperature / critical temperature

Another equation for describing the behaviour of a real gas is van der Waals equation of state: $(p+\frac{a}{v^2})(v-b)=RT$, where a and b are constants. 

This equation allows for the attractive force between molecules with the $a/v^2$ term, and the volume occupied by them, $b$

A substance in the two-phase liquid-vapour region consists of both liquid and vapour coexisting in equilibrium
x is called the dryness fraction of the mixture
Each 1kg of mixture contains x kg of vapour and (1-x)kg of liquid

Volume of the mixture: $V=m_fv_f+m_gv_g$
Specific volume of the mixture: $v=\frac{V}{m}=v_f+x(v_g-v_f)=v_f+xv_{fg}$

Thus the dryness factor provides a measure of how far the phase change has proceeded

The main tables of note in the CUED data book are those for water and steam
The data book is incredibly useful, learn where everything is

Diagram types:
T-s diagram: Most commonly used for cycles, good for comparing to Carnot
h-s diagram: Easiest graph to solve cycle problems on, much quicker than using tables
p-h diagram: Used for refrigerant calculations, not as easy to use

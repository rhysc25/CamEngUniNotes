The rotor can have an number of pole pairs.

If we have an 18 slot stator:

$\tilde{\phi}_1$ of coil $(1,10)$ induces $\tilde{E}_1$
$\tilde{E}_A = \tilde{E}_1 + \tilde{E}_2 + \tilde{E}_3$
$|\tilde{V}_A|= |\tilde{V}_B|= |\tilde{V}_C|= V$

If the max current per coil is $I_{max}$, the maximum power is $3VI_{max}$
If the coils were instead in series so one phase, the max power would be $2VI_{max}$ so $2/3$ of the equivalent 3 phase generator.

Each phase produces a square wave whose primary harmonic is a sinusoid which has peak value $4/\pi$ compared to the square wave.

Considering magnetic field due to stator currents:
Flux crosses the air-gap radially since iron is a very good conductor or magnetic flux.
$B(\theta)=\hat{B}\cos(\theta - \gamma)$ where $\hat{B} = \frac{2\mu_0 IN}{\pi g}$ where g is the air gap length
Coils B and C will produce similar flux density distributions, displaced by $\pm 120 \degree$

Superposing the fields they produce:
$B(\theta, t) = B(\theta, t)_A + B(\theta, t)_B + B(\theta, t)_C = \frac{2\mu_0 \hat{I} N}{\pi g}\cos(\omega t - \theta)$
Important: Balanced three-phase currents flowing in a balanced three-phase winding produce a rotating magnetic field

**Multiple Poles**
Stator coils arranged AB'CA'BC' over $360\degree$ gives 2 pole winding, or 1 pole pair (p=1)
Repeating pattern: AB'CA'BC'AB'CA'BC' over $360\degree$ gives 4 pole winding, or 2 pole pairs (p=2)
Rotating field $B(\theta , t) = \hat{B} \cos(\omega t - p\theta)$
By analogy with travelling wave equation its angular speed is $\omega / p$
This physical speed is known as the synchronous speed. This speed must be varied so that the $\omega$ of the electricity produced is constant

**Stand-alone and Parallel Operation**
Stator of a synchronous generator can be connected to its own three-phase load. Frequency of supply set by rotor speed. The vast majority of generators have stators connect to the grid. Therefore no individual generator can affect its terminal voltage V. V is fixed magnitude and frequency, called the infinite bus.

**Conditions for Steady Power Conversion**
For steady conversion of energy, the electromagnetic torque must be constant. Two conditions are required:
1) The rotor and stator-driven fields must have the same number of poles
2) The rotor and stator-driven fields must rotate at the same angular speed
Generators only produce steady power conversion when rotating at synchronous speed. Hence this type of generator is known as a synchronous generator.

**Equivalent Circuit**
The equivalent circuit pertains to one stator phase. 
The rotor-driven field induces excitation voltage E. It is assumed to be proportional to the rotor field current/ rotor excitation.

Stator-driven field proportional to stator current. It caused a back emf in the stator winding due to stator self and mutual inductances. These are lumped into $X_s$ the synchronous reactance.
Stator winding resistance is ignored.

The rotor can have an number of pole pairs.

If we have an 18 slot stator:
![[Pasted image 20260202120804.png]]

$\tilde{\phi}_1$ of coil $(1,10)$ induces $\tilde{E}_1$
$\tilde{E}_A = \tilde{E}_1 + \tilde{E}_2 + \tilde{E}_3$
$|\tilde{V}_A|= |\tilde{V}_B|= |\tilde{V}_C|= V$

If the max current per coil is $I_{max}$, the maximum power is $3VI_{max}$
If the coils were instead in series so one phase, the max power would be $2VI_{max}$ so $2/3$ of the equivalent 3 phase generator.

Each phase produces a square wave whose primary harmonic is a sinusoid which has peak value $4/\pi$ compared to the square wave.

Considering magnetic field due to stator currents:
Flux crosses the air-gap radially since iron is a very good conductor or magnetic flux.
$B(\theta)=\hat{B}\cos(\theta - \gamma)$ where $\hat{B} = \frac{2\mu_0 IN}{\pi g}$ where g is the air gap length
Coils B and C will produce similar flux density distributions, displaced by $\pm 120 \degree$

Superposing the fields they produce:
$B(\theta, t) = B(\theta, t)_A + B(\theta, t)_B + B(\theta, t)_C = \frac{2\mu_0 \hat{I} N}{\pi g}\cos(\omega t - \theta)$
Important: Balanced three-phase currents flowing in a balanced three-phase winding produce a rotating magnetic field

**Multiple Poles**
Stator coils arranged AB'CA'BC' over $360\degree$ gives 2 pole winding, or 1 pole pair (p=1)
Repeating pattern: AB'CA'BC'AB'CA'BC' over $360\degree$ gives 4 pole winding, or 2 pole pairs (p=2)
Rotating field $B(\theta , t) = \hat{B} \cos(\omega t - p\theta)$
By analogy with travelling wave equation its angular speed is $\omega / p$
This physical speed is known as the synchronous speed. This speed must be varied so that the $\omega$ of the electricity produced is constant

**Stand-alone and Parallel Operation**
Stator of a synchronous generator can be connected to its own three-phase load. Frequency of supply set by rotor speed. The vast majority of generators have stators connect to the grid. Therefore no individual generator can affect its terminal voltage V. V is fixed magnitude and frequency, called the infinite bus.

**Conditions for Steady Power Conversion**
For steady conversion of energy, the electromagnetic torque must be constant. Two conditions are required:
1) The rotor and stator-driven fields must have the same number of poles
2) The rotor and stator-driven fields must rotate at the same angular speed
Generators only produce steady power conversion when rotating at synchronous speed. Hence this type of generator is known as a synchronous generator.

**Equivalent Circuit**
The equivalent circuit pertains to one stator phase. 
The rotor-driven field induces excitation voltage E. It is assumed to be proportional to the rotor field current/ rotor excitation.

This is motor convention where the current is going into the circuit
Generator convention has it going out, changing the sign in the equation

Stator-driven field proportional to stator current. It caused a back emf in the stator winding due to stator self and mutual inductances. These are lumped into $X_s$ the synchronous reactance.
Stator winding resistance is ignored.
Terminal voltage V indicated by infinite bus.

**Control of Real Power**
$P_{out,elec}=3VI\cos(\phi)$
If we neglect power losses, the input mechanical power must equal the output electrical power. So the output power is controlled by the torque and angular velocity of the prime mover
$T\omega_s = 3VI\cos(\phi)$
From the phasor diagram, $E\sin(\delta) = X_s I \cos(\phi)$, so $T=\frac{3VE \sin(\delta)}{\omega_s X_s}$
V is the grid voltage, so constant. E is the voltage induced by the rotor, which is fixed as there's fixed excitation field

$\delta$ is the load angle
This is the angle between the rotor driven field and the total field.
If there is greater demand for real power, we must increase this angle
To increase the angle, we increase the torque of the prime mover

**Control of Reactive Power**
In power systems demand for both real and reactive power must be matched by the supply. E.g. motors require a supply of reactive power as they often have lagging power factors.
If we keep real power constant, then $E\sin(\delta)$ is constant, so the vertical height of E is constant, but the length changes.
Also the horizontal projection of the current $I\cos(\phi)$ is constant

1) The first diagram shows the generator normally-excited
2) If we increase E, the current lags the voltage so the machine supplies VARs, so is over-excited
3) If we decrease E, the current leads the voltage so the machine absorbs VARs, so is under-excited
You change E by adjusting the DC excitation current in the rotor field winding.

In the extreme case that we have $P=0$, the machine either purely supplies or absorbs reactive power. So they can be used to correct power factor. We call this a synchronous compensator.

**Construction**
Stators must be laminated to prevent eddy currents
Rotors either fitted with slip rings and brushes or a small on board AC generator and rectifier to supply the field current
**Rating**
Stator heating limit - set by max stator current.
Rotor heating limit - set by max rotor current, so there's a max E.
Generator voltage limited by flux and insulation considerations.

Generators have a VA rating: $$3V_{ph}I_{ph}$$

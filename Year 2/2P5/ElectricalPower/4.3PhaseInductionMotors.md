The stator is wound with a balanced three-phase winding, which is excited by a balanced three-phase voltage supply

The stator rotating field is NOT the same speed as the rotors physical rotation - Asynchronous
Viewed from the rotor, the stator driven field appears the same as when viewed from the stator, except rotating at speed $\omega_s-\omega_r$

Slip: $s=\frac{\omega_s-\omega_r}{\omega_s}$
The field rotates at $\frac{s\omega}{p}=s\omega_s$ with respect to the motor

Balanced three phase currents of frequency $s\omega$ flow

The stator and rotor-driven fields have the same number of poles, and rotate at the same speed. These are the conditions required for a steady state torque to be produced.

If the rotor rotates at synchronous speed, the rotor sees a stationary field, so no emf induced, so no currents in the rotor, so no rotor-driven field, so no torque
At all other rotor speeds, torque is produced. Asynchronous motor.

Equivalent circuit -
Stator on the left, rotor on the right

When stationary, the induction motor is similar to a transformer with the secondary short-circuited.

$R_1:$ Stator winding resistance
$X_1:$ Stator leakage reactance
$R_2:$ Rotor winding resistance
$X_2:$ Rotor leakage reactance
$X_m:$ Magnetising reactance
$R_0:$ Iron loss resistance

k is the effective turns ratio. Stator : rotor turns. $E_1 / E_2 = k$. $kI_1=I_2$
Induced emf per phase in the stationary rotor: $E_2=I_2(R_2+jX_2)$

Now if we allow the rotor to rotate with slip s
$E_2 \rightarrow sE_2$ because $\omega \rightarrow s\omega$
Also $X_2 \rightarrow sX_2$ as $X_2$ calculated using frequency

Therefore $sE_2=I_s(R_2+jsX_2)$ or $E_2=I_2(\frac{R_2}{s}+jX_2)$

Refer the rotor parameters to the stator and combine in an equivalent circuit:

Use this to find rotating speed and power and torque and so on. This is a per phase model so will have to multiply any powers by 3.

**Determination of Equivalent Circuit Parameters**
* No load / open circuit test - finds $R_0$ and $X_m$
No load so no mechanical torque. $\omega_r = \omega_s \Rightarrow s=0 \Rightarrow R'_2/s \rightarrow \infty$
![[Pasted image 20260218140811.png]]
$P=3\frac{V_{ph}^2}{R_0}$

* Locked rotor test - finds $R'_2, X_2', X_1$
Rotor locked, $s=1$. 
$R_2'/s$ is small. Parallel components may be neglected in comparison to series components, giving this equivalent circuit:
![[Pasted image 20260218141336.png]]
$P=3I_{ph}^2(R_1+ R_2')$
Can't really precisely distinguish $R_1$ and $R_2'$

Construction:
* Stator: Same as synchronous machine: laminated, carries a balanced three phase winding
* Rotor: Rotor winding must produce a rotating magnetic field with the same number of poles as the stator. Must be laminated. The two options are:
1) Wound rotor: The three phase windings of same pole number as stator winding. Can be short circuited or provided with slip rings and brushes, enabling external resistances to be added to rotor circuit
2) Cage rotor: Single conductor per slot. Joined at ends by thick conducting end-rings. May be fabricated or die-cast

**Power and Torque in Induction Motors**
![[Pasted image 20260218143225.png]]
Can split $R_2'/s$ as such. $R_2'$ contributes to the copper loss, $(1-s)R_2'/s$ is considered as containing the output power. 
Summing the power losses: $P_{loss} = 3I_0^2R_0+3I_{in}^2R_1+3I_2'^2R_2'$

$P_{in}=P_{out}+P_{loss}$

$P_{out}=2I_2'^2 \frac{R_2'}{s}(1-s)$
Mechanical power is $T\omega_r=T\omega_s(1-s)$
Therefore $T=\frac{3I_2'^2 R_2'}{s\omega_s}$

T is the gross torque. There is also a mechanical loss torque $T_{net}=T-T_{loss}$
If the voltage across $R_1$ and $X_1$ assumed to be small we can bring $R_0$ and $X_m$ across the terminals

Variation of Torque with Speed:
![[Pasted image 20260218144744.png]]

Can read values from this graph, such as the synchronous speed (when T=0)
When $0\leq s \leq 1$ we are in motoring mode (electrical to mechanical power)
We can see that there is a value of s which produces the maximum value of T
If $s<0$ we go into generating mode. Input torque, creates electrical power.

To find this maximum value of torque:
![[Pasted image 20260218145510.png]]
We know that maximum output power when $R_L=R_{out}$ so $R_2'/s_{max} = \sqrt{R_1^2+(X_1+X_2')^2}$
We can then determine this expression: $T_{max}=\frac{3V^2}{2\omega_s(Z_s+R_1)}$

Rotor resistance torque/speed control (Not examinable)
$T_{max}$ is independent of $R_2'$. $s_m\propto R_2'$

Adding extra rotor resistance at starting will increase torque and reduce starting current

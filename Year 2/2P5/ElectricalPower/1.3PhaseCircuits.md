Three main aspects are: Generation, Transmission and distribution, Utilisation
The common thread which links all of them is the use of balanced three-phase a.c. systems at 50Hz

**Star-connected load**
![[StarConnected.png]]

The resulting three-phase supply is star-connected. The centre of the star is at 0V.

Consists of three voltages of equal magnitude, but differing in phase by 120 degrees with respect to each other.

We can draw a phase diagram where:
$\tilde{V}_A=Ve^{j0}=V$, $\tilde{V}_B=Ve^{-j\frac{2\pi}{3}}$, and $\tilde{V}_C=Ve^{j\frac{2\pi}{3}}$
Phase voltages are measured to ground

Line voltages: Voltages between pairs of lines, e.g. 
$\tilde{V}_{AB}=\tilde{V}_A-\tilde{V}_B$

$|\tilde{V}_{AB}|=2|\tilde{V}_A|\sin(60)=\sqrt{3}V$
and $\angle \tilde{V}_{AB}=\angle \tilde{V}_A + 30\degree = 30\degree$
Line voltage = $\sqrt{3} \space \times$ phase voltage 

All of the loads are balanced too, with magnitude: $\overline{Z}$
So $\overline{I}_A=\frac{\overline{V}_A}{\overline{Z}}$, and $\overline{I}_B=\overline{I}_A e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{3}}$ and similar for $\overline{I}_C$
The angle between $\bar{V}_C$ and $\bar{I}_C$ is $\phi$, where $\cos{\phi}=\frac{Re(Z)}{|Z|}$, the power factor

The current form a balanced three-phase set, and line current = phase current
All these currents sum to zero, so the current flowing from the centre of the impedance star to the centre of the supply star is zero.
So for a balanced 3-phase load it doesn't matter whether or not the neutral conductor is connected

If we consider the complex volt-amps in each phase, they are all equal to $\tilde{V}_A \tilde{I}_A^*=\overline{S}_A$
Therefore, for a balanced 3-phase load: P, Q and S are identical in each phase
$\overline{S}_{TOTAL}=3\overline{S}_A$

Total 3-phase P = 3 times P per phase
Total 3-phase Q = 3 times Q per phase
Total 3-phase S = 3 times S per phase

As each phases behaves identically, we only need to analyse one of them

**Delta-connected load**

![[DeltaConnectedLoad.png]]
It is clear that the voltage across each phase of the load equals the line voltage

The load currents will form a balanced 3-phase set
$\tilde{I}_1=I$, $\tilde{I}_2=Ie^{-j\frac{2\pi}{3}}$, $\tilde{I}_3=Ie^{j\frac{2\pi}{3}}$
Trigonometry shows that the line currents (that is $\overline{I}_A$ for example) is $\sqrt{3}$ times the phase current. We get to this by considering $\bar{I}_A=\bar{I}_1-\bar{I}_3$ in phasor representation

Similarly, the supply could also be connected in delta since $\tilde{V}_A+\tilde{V}_B+\tilde{V}_C=0$
![[DeltaConnectSupply.png]]

The star-delta and delta-star transformations can be found in the data book.
For balanced loads: $\overline{Z}_{delta}=3\overline{Z}_{star}$

For both star-connected and delta-connected, $P=\sqrt{3}V_lI_l\cos(\theta)$, where $V_l$ and $I_l$ are the line quantities. $Q=\sqrt{3}V_lI_l\sin(\theta)$, and $S=\sqrt{3}V_lI_l$

In a question, if a voltage is mentioned without specifying phase or line, by default it means line, as line can be measured easily in real life.

**An Overview of Electrical Generation**
The prime mover, some sort of turbine, generates the rotary shaft power.
This is fed to an AC synchronous generator, which generates electrical power, which is sends to the power grid.

Features:
* No easy bulk storage so generated power must equal consumed power at all times. Use pooled spinning reserve to react instantly to changes in demand
* Supplier has no control over variations in demand so variable rate tariffs
* Further demand predicted to increase
* Economical and environmental considerations both important - nuclear power used for base load
* Security of supply also important - large degree of interconnection - synchronised power supply with a common supply frequency

**Basic Principles of A.C. Generators**
A generator consists of a stator and a rotor. The stator is stationary, the rotor is supported by bearing and is free to rotate when driven round be the prime mover.
DC current is fed into the rotor coils via slip rings and brushes, setting up a magnetic field.

The currents in the rotor and the shape of the rotor are designed so that the air-gap field varies sinusoidally with $\theta$: $B(\theta)=\hat{B}\cos(\theta)$ (with the rotor stationary)
When the rotor is driven at speed $\omega_r$:
$B(\theta,t)=\hat{B}\cos(\omega_r t - \theta)$

To find the flux linking a single stator coil, we want to integrate around half of the cylinder.
$\delta \phi = B\delta A = B wr \delta \theta = \hat{B} wr \cos(\omega_r t - \theta)\delta \theta$
Integrating this up gives: $\phi = 2\hat{B}wr\sin(\omega_rt - \alpha)$
Then applying Faraday's law: $e=N\frac{d\phi}{dt}$
This gives us that $e=2N\hat{B}wr\omega_r\cos(\omega_rt -\alpha)=\hat{E}\cos(\omega_rt-\alpha)$

* A rotating, sinusoidally distributed air-gap flux density induces a sinusoidally time varying emf in the stator coil
* The frequency and magnitude of the emf are proportional to $\omega_r$.
* The phase of the emf $\alpha$ is the same of the angular position of the stator coil.

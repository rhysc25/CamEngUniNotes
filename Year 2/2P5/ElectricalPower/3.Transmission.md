A single 3-phase line

G is very small and ignored. $X_C$ ignored. R ignored except when calculating power loss through the line. We will only consider $X_L$

We can form a triangle as before:

Power at the receiving end: $P_r=3V_r I \cos(\phi)$
$P_r=3V_r I \cos(\phi)=\frac{3V_rV_s\sin(\delta)}{X_L}$
This is the same as $P_s$ as no real power loss as only transmission line reactance.
The real power is controlled by varying the angle of $V_s$ wrt $V_r$

$Q_r=\frac{3V_r(V_s\cos\delta - V_r)}{X_L}$
$Q_s=\frac{3V_s(V_s- V_r\cos\delta)}{X_L}$
From conservation of reactive power $Q_S-Q_r=3I^2X_L$

$Q_{ave}=\frac{Q_r+Q_s}{2}=\frac{3(V_S^2-V_R^2)}{2X_L}$
It is also equal to $Q_r+\frac{Q_{\text{lost in trans line}}}{2}$

The reactive power is controlled by $V_S-V_r=\Delta V$
Corollary: increasing $Q_{load}=Q_r$ can result in under-voltage or even voltage collapse

Limitations of transfer of P and Q - 
P is limited by $\delta=90\degree$ but it never gets anywhere close due to stability and transmission line currents
Voltage mainly limits the transfer of Q.
Thermal limit: $I^2R$ losses create heating causing lines to sag. Risk of flashover.
Main limitation is rated current $I_{rated}$ for P

The total real power supplied must match the total real power demanded.
If $P_{gen}<P_{dem}$ we have three types of response, each happening after the other if the previous is not sufficient

Primary response - frequency falls
Secondary response - use reserve capacity to increase $P_{gen}$
Tertiary response - Low Frequency Demand Disconnection (LFDD)

The statutory limit for frequency: $49.5$Hz - $50.5$Hz

Nuclear, CCGT, hydro, biomass all use rotating machinery to produce power hence rotational stored energy is a by product of these forms.
$RKE_i=\frac{1}{2}J_i\omega^2_{s_i}=\frac{1}{2}J_i(\frac{2\pi f}{p_i})^2$
Total rotational energy obtained by summing over all generating plants:
$RKE_{Total}=2\pi^2f^2\sum J_i / p_i^2 = Kf^2$
K is the grid inertia constant, its value depends on the precise generating mix.

If there is a high demand, a greater proportion of generation comes from nuclear, CCGT, hydro, biomass, hence K is high.
$$\Delta P = \frac{d(RKE_{Total})}{dt}=2Kf\frac{df}{df}$$
$f$ in this equation is pretty much almost $50$Hz as initially that's the frequency, then when the secondary response kicks in, we put the frequency back to $50$Hz
The UK reserve capacity is about $1.4$GW.
There is a table for the LFDD% if the secondary response is not sufficient, depending on the current frequency.

Varying voltage - 
* Excitation of synchronous generators is varied
Correcting power factor - 
* Switched banks of capacitors
* Synchronous machines run of compensators

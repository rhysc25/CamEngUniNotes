A is the forward gain, the open loop gain, the gain of the circuit on its own
B is the gain of the feedback system
AB is the loop gain

Closed loop gain, G:
$G=\frac{v_0}{v_1}=\frac{A}{1+AB}$
If A is large, as is often the case with OpAmp circuits, then gain $\approx \frac{1}{B}$
This means that the gain is determined purely by the feedback network and not loosely specified on the parameters of the amplifier itself

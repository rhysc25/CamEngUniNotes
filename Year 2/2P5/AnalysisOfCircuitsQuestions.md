How can we use the almost constant voltage drop over a Zener diode to create a constant current source?

As Zener diodes are too large to get into ICs, what's a more elegant way of making a current source?

**Negative Feedback**

What happens to the input and output resistance when negative feedback is introduced?

How is this difference for a current amplifier?

What is the equation for $V_o$ for a non-ideal op amp?

Why should we ensure that no resistors connected anywhere near $R_o$ or $R_i$ are nowhere near them in resistor value?

Explain what the input offset voltage is and how can we reduce it?

For a difference amplifier using an opamp, what is the CMRR limited by?

What does a gyrator circuit do?

How do we define efficiency when we have a load connected in a transistor circuit?

What is our time averaged power?

If our $V_{CE}=\frac{V_{CC}}{2}$ then what is our max $v_o$ and hence max efficiency?

When we have a complementary source or emitter follower, only one transistor is on at a time, so what class is this amplifier?

How would we find the power drawn from one of the supplies, in order to work out the efficiency?

What does the output characteristic of this circuit look like, and what's the problem with the deadband?

How can we fix this with diodes, and what class is this new operation?

Number of DoFs: number of coordinates needed to describe the configuration of a system
Generalised coordinates are not unique: any N degrees of freedom system would require a set of minimum N generalised coordinates to fully describe its motion

The Lagrangian method is derived from the fact that $F=\frac{d}{dt}(p)$

Consider a system with N DoFs described by a convenient set of generalised coordinates: 
$q_1,q_2,q_3,...,q_N$

The Lagrangian is the difference between the kinetic (T) and potential (V) energies.
$L(q_j,\dot{q}_j)=T-V$
The Lagrangian is parameterised in terms of $q$ and $\dot{q}$, which are treated as two independent parameters
$$\frac{d}{dt}(p_j)=F_j$$
Where $p_j=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j}$ and $F_j=\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_j}$

To write the Lagrange equations, we assumed the system is holonomic. I.e. the current state of the system can be fully described by the instantaneous displacements and velocities, i.e. the displacements and velocities are independent at a given instant in time.

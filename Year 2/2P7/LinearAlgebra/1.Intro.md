The column space of $A$ is the set of $\textbf{f}$ for which $A\textbf{t}=\textbf{f}$
This is also the row space of $A^T$
The set of $\textbf{n}$ for which $A\textbf{n}=0$ is the null space
In the context of a set of bar forces, this would give a state of self stress
The left null space of A is the $\textbf{d}$ for which $A^T\textbf{d}=0$

A matrix is m x n. It has m rows and n columns
It transforms an n dimensional vector into an m dimensional vector, so maps $R^n$ to $R^m$

If we move to higher dimensions than 3, our dot product and magnitude still work, but the cross product doesn't, as we can't find a single direction $\hat{\textbf{n}}$ which is orthogonal to three vectors.

$A\textbf{x}=A(x\textbf{i}+y\textbf{j}+z\textbf{k})=x\textbf{a}_1+y\textbf{a}_2+z\textbf{a}_3$
We can create a matrix if we know how it transforms the three basis vectors

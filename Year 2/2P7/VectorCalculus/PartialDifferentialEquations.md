Vector equations are independent of coord system. We must choose the most appropriate and find out PDEs.
We have a PDE for each dependant variable we have.
We will be considering PDEs with one dependent scalar variable and two independent variables, so we only have one PDE to solve.

ODEs require either initial conditions or boundary conditions to find the exact solution.

For PDEs, these are actually boundary function, e.g. $\phi(x_1,0), \phi(x_2,0), \phi(0,t)$
If $\phi$ is a function of 2D space, $\phi = \phi(x,y)$ then the boundary conditions for the PDE are usually specified around a closed loop.

**Categorising PDEs**
The order of a PDE is the highest order partial derivative in the equation.
A PDE is linear if it satisfies superposition. If $\phi=\phi_1$ and $\phi=\phi_2$ are solutions, then $\phi=A\phi_1+B\phi_2$ are solutions
If a PDE is linear, new solutions can be generated by linear combinations of known simple solutions. In some cases, it is possible to match any prescribed boundary function by summing a linear combination of simple solutions that are known to satisfy the PDE. Reminiscent of Fourier series.

**Classification of Second Order PDEs**
Second order PDEs are either elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic. Elliptic PDEs are of the boundary value type. Parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs are of the initial condition type.

Archetypal Elliptic PDE - Laplace's Equation
Used in steady 2D heat conduction. $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$.
This arises when the flux vector $\textbf{V}$ can be written $\textbf{V}=\nabla \phi$ so no sources and sinks and the divergence is zero
If $\textbf{V}$ is not solenoidal, such that $\nabla \cdot \textbf{V}=S(x,y)$ we get Poisson's equation:
$\nabla^2 \phi = S(x,y)$

Archetypal Parabolic PDE - Unsteady heat conduction/ diffusion equation
In we have $-\lambda(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\delta y)$ and out we have $-\lambda(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}\delta x)\delta y$, leading to a change in the control volume of $\rho c \delta x \delta y \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$
This gives $\nabla^2 \phi=\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}=\frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$ where $\alpha$ is the diffusivity

Archetypal Hyperbolic PDE - Wave Equation
Considering an element of the wave:
![[Pasted image 20251124120249.png]]
The wave equation arises when $\frac{\partial \textbf{V}}{\partial t}$ is proportional to $\nabla \phi$ and $\nabla \cdot \textbf{V}$ is proportional to $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$. In 1-D Cartesians:
$\nabla^2 \phi = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}=\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t}$ where c is a constant and the speed of propagation of the wave

Laplace's equation, the diffusion equation and the wave equation are all linear. Poisson's equation can be linear, depending on whether $S(x,y)$ is linear

**Solving Partial Differential Equations**

If $\phi = \phi(x,y)$, assume solution of the form $\phi=X(x)Y(y)$

If we sub this into Laplace's equation, $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$, we get $\frac{1}{X}\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2}=-\frac{1}{y}\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2}$
As x and y can both vary, it is clear that both of these must be equal to some constant. This is called the separation constant. 

This constant can either be positive, negative or zero. 

If it is positive, expressed as $\alpha^2$, we get two differential equations, giving:
$X(x)=A\sin(\alpha x)+B\cos(\alpha x)$
$Y(y)=C\exp(\alpha y)+D\exp(- \alpha y)$
If we see the Y boundary conditions looking exponential, or the X boundary conditions looking sinusoidal, we use this

Alternatively, if the constant is negative, expressed as $-\alpha^2$, we get:
$X(x)=A\exp(\alpha x)+B\exp(- \alpha x)$
$Y(y)=C\sin(\alpha y)+D\cos(\alpha y)$
This is essentially just the X and Y flipped

If the separation constant is zero, then both X and Y are linear functions.
Once we have these general functions, then we sub in our boundary conditions and compare

When solving a diffusion equation example, we will pretty much always require a negative separation constant. This is because a positive one would lead to exponential increase in time, and a zero would mean it's completely time independent.
We will get something of the form:
$X(x)=A\sin(\beta x)+B\cos(\beta x)$
$T(t)=C\exp(-\alpha \beta^2 t)$

Once we have a solution with sinusoids, we can sum any multiple of those solutions, according to a Fourier series, and generate any arbitrary boundary condition by linearity

**The Wave Equation**
Energy propagated at a finite velocity.

$\frac{\partial ^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}=\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial ^2 \phi}{\partial t^2}$, where c is the wave speed
This can be solved by separation of variables, but can also be solved using D'Alembert's solution.

D'Alembert's Solution - 
First we consider a first order PDE that also exhibits wave-like behaviour: $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}$
We construct a compound variable $\eta=ct-x$ and we express $\phi$ as $\phi=f(\eta)=f(ct-x)$

By the chain rule $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}=\frac{df}{d\eta}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t}=c\frac{df}{d\eta}$, and a similar process for $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}$, showing that it satisfies the equation.
This shows a right running wave. The wave travels unchanged, without distortion, as we have no damping. 
We can also consider a left running wave where $\xi=ct+x$

We can show that the solution to our second order wave equation is a linear superposition of a right and a left running wave: $\phi(x,t)=f(ct-x)+g(ct+x)=f(\eta)+g(\xi)$
$ct-x$ and $ct+x$ lines are characteristics of the PDE
This is a hyperbolic PDE - 2 independent variables, with 2 independent real characteristics.

Boundary conditions:
* Initial shape $\phi=F(x)$ for $0\leq x\leq L$ at t=0
* Initially at rest, so $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}=0$ for $0\leq x\leq L$ at t=0
* $\phi=0$ at $x=0$ and at $x=L$ always

If the initial shape $F(x)$ is sinusoidal we get harmonic waves. If we have two waves trains of equal frequency and amplitude (and zero phase angles), but travelling in the opposite directions, we obtain:
$\phi(x,t)=A\cos(\omega t-kx)+A\cos(\omega t + kx)=2A\cos(k x) \cos(\omega t)$

If we do separation of variables, we get that $\phi(x,t)=B'_n \sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})\cos(\frac{n\pi ct}{L})$
The angular frequency of oscillation is $\frac{n\pi c}{L}$. 

The amplitude varies with x and equals $B'_n \sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})$. The shape of the initial distribution determines the proportions of each harmonic that are present. Using a Fourier series, any specific initial shape can be matched.

We can see that if you want to increase spatial frequency, i.e. more wavelengths in the length L, we can see that the frequency of oscillation must also increase.

**Self Similar Solutions**

This can only be done on certain scenarios:
* The boundary conditions are steady with time
* There is no inherent length scale, implied semi-infinite

A good example of this is to consider the diffusion equation. For these, self similar solutions are based on the idea of a diffusion length, the length of the zone of increased temperature.

Using dimensional analysis with the 3 variables $l,\alpha, t$ where $\alpha$ is the diffusivity, we get that our one dimensionless variable is $\frac{l}{\sqrt{\alpha t}}$, which must be a constant, c. $l=c\sqrt{\alpha t}$
If the problem had been finite with some finite depth H, this wouldn't have been a possible conclusion.

Considering again the equation, it is now natural to seek a solution of the form: $\frac{T-T_0}{\Delta T}=f(\frac{x}{\sqrt{\alpha t}})$
This is called a self similar solution because, as long as x is normalised by l, the solution looks the same from one moment to the next, as time does not explicitly appear in the solution. If we plot $\frac{T-T_0}{\Delta T}$ against $\frac{x}{\sqrt{\alpha t}}$ we would get a constant curve, not varying with time so to speak.

We know that $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}=\frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$. If we create new variable $\eta = x/l = x/\sqrt{\alpha t}$, we get an expression we can solve, giving $f(\eta)=A\int_0^{\eta}\exp(-\eta^2/4)d\eta+B$
If instead $l'=2l=2\sqrt{\alpha t}$, then we can write it as an error function

$\frac{T-T_0}{\Delta T}=1-erf(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{\alpha t}})$

Both the scalar and vector product are distributive:
$\textbf{a}\times(\textbf{b}+\textbf{c})=\textbf{a}\times\textbf{b}+\textbf{a}\times \textbf{c}$

A vector field is just made up of scalar fields. But it would be inconvenient to keep track of them all at the same time

Field lines - tangential to the vector field $\textbf{V}$ at all times. 
It shows direction, but not magnitude.

How to form them: Create a tangential $\delta s$. Move to the end of it and repeat. As $\delta s \rightarrow 0$, the line becomes exactly tangential to $\textbf{V}$ so forms a field line

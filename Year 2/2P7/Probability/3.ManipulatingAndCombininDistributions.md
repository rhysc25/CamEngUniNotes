**Functions of random variables**
Discrete random variables -

Let's say that we had $Y=g(X)$
$P_{Y=g(X)}(y)=\sum_{\{x:g(x)=y\}} P_X(x)$ where $\{x:g(x)=y\}$ is the preimage of y under g, so the values of x that go to the value of y.
If g is invertible (one-to-one) then $P_{Y=g(X)}(y)=P_X(g^{-1}(y))$

Continuous random variables -
Let $Y=g(X)$. Its CDF is $F_Y(y)=P[Y\leq y]=P[g(X)\leq y]$

If $g$ is strictly monotonic so one-to-one: $$f_{Y=g(X)}(y)=\frac{f_X(g^{-1}(y))}{|g'(g^{-1}(y))|}$$
Rule of thumb: A way to remember the change of variable formula is $|f_Y(y)dy|=|f_X(x)dx|$ so that $f_Y(y)=\frac{f_X(x)}{|\frac{dy}{dx}|}|_{x=g^{-1}(y)}$

For a non-monotonic transform, the PDF is the sum over all branches. It will most likely be symmetric or antisymmetric.

Affine transformation - 
Let $Y=aX + b$, then $f_Y(y)=\frac{1}{|a|}f_X(\frac{y-b}{a})$
$E[Y]=aE[X]+b$ and $Var[Y]=a^2 Var[X]$

**Sum of Random Variables**
Let $S=X+Y$
$E[S]=E[X]+E[Y]$
$Var[S]=Var[X]+Var[Y]+2Cov[X,Y]$ were $Cov[X,Y]=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$
The correlation coefficient - $\rho = \frac{Cov[X,Y]}{\sqrt{Var[X]Var[Y]}}$
$\rho > 0$ is positive correlation

Sum of discrete variables - 
By the law of total probability - $P_S(s)=\sum_{y\in Y}P[X+Y=s|Y=y]P_Y(y)$
This simplifies down to $P_S(s)=\sum_{y\in Y}P_X(s-y)P_Y(y)= \sum_{x\in X}P_Y(s-x)P_X(x)$
That is, $P_{X+Y}=P_X * P_Y$ (Discrete convolution)

Sum of continuous variables - 
X and Y continuous variables with joint PDF $f_{XY}(x,y)$
The CDF of S is the area enclosed by this region:

Which is $F_S(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{s-y}f_{xy}(x,y)dxdy$
Differentiating with respect to s we get the PDF: $f_S(s)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_X(s-y)f_Y(y)dy$
That is, $f_{X+Y}=f_X * f_Y$ (Convolution)

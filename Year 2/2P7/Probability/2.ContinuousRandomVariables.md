Continuous random variables are those with a continuous support, whether than be finite or infinite.

**CDF - Cumulative Density Function**
In general, $P[X=x] = 0$ for a continuous random variable
We can still consider events corresponding to intervals
The CDF is $F_X(x)=P[X\leq x]$
$P[a<X\leq b]=F_X(b)-F_X(a)$

**PDF - Probability Density Function**
$$f_X(x)=\frac{dF_X(x)}{dx}$$
$f_X(x)dx\approx P[x<X\leq x+dx]$ = the probability of X in the infinitesimal interval $(x,x+dx]$
Probabilities can be found by integrating the PDF: $\int_a^b f_X (x)dx = F_X(b)-F_X(a)$
Normalisation: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_X (x) dx = 1$

**Joint PDF**
$$f_{XY}(x,y)=\frac{\partial^2 F_{XY}(x,y)}{\partial x \partial y}$$
where $F_{XY}(x,y)=P[X\leq x \cap Y \leq y]$
Marginalisation: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{XY}(x,y)dy=f_X(x)$
Conditional PDF: $f_{X|Y}(x|y)=\frac{f_{XY}(x,y)}{f_{Y}(y)}$, and from this we can get Bayes theorem
And yes, this is conditioning on $Y=y$ exactly
Law of total probability: $f_X(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{X|Y}(x|y)f_Y(y)dy$

Conditional independence: 
If X and Y are conditionally independent given $Z=z$ then $f_{XY|Z}(x,y|z)=f_{X|Z}(x|z)f_{Y|Z}(Y|Z)$ 
This is equivalent to saying $f_{X|YZ}(x|yz)=f_{X|Z}(x|z)$

**Expectation and Moments of a PDF**
The PDF can be used to compute expectations
$E[X^n]$ is the nth moment
$E[(X-E[X])^n]$ is the nth central moment
Mean/ first moment = $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf_X(x)dx$
Standard deviation, $\sigma = \sqrt{Var[X]}$

$E[X|Y=y]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x f_{X|Y}(x,y) dx$
In general, one can define a PDF for a discrete random variable using the delta function. If X discrete with PMF $P_X$ and support $\mathbb{X}$, then:
$f_X(x)=\sum P_X(k)\delta(x-k)$

**Characteristics of a PDF**
* Mode: value of x at which $f_X(x)$ is max
* Median: value $Q_{1/2}$ such that $F_X(Q_{1/2})=1/2$, so splits the area under the PDF into two equal parts. There is also an upper and lower quartile, and an interquartile range
* Skewness: $\frac{E[(X-E[X])^3]}{\sigma^3}$. Positive skew indicates a longer right tail

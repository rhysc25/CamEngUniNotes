When the temperature varies in a process, phase transformations take place. These transformations determine the final phases present and distribution - that is, the final microstructure.

The real microstructure may not be at equilibrium, but phase diagrams give a starting point from which other (non-equilibrium) microstructures can often be inferred.

Techniques to determine the phase of a substance:
* Dilatometry - measurement of dimensional change due to different density
* Resistivity - measurement of electrical resistivity
* Calorimetry - differential measurement of release or take-up of latent heat 
* Optical microscopy - differential reflection of light, either in colour or intensity
* X-ray diffraction - diffraction of X-radiation by the crystal lattice of each phase, giving diffraction patterns
* Scanning electron microscope - differential back scattering of electrons 
* Transmission electron microscope - diffraction of an electron beam by the crystal pattern

**Solidification of Pure Metals**

For homogeneous nucleation, solid colonies form spontaneously, growing stably provided they can reach a critical radius governed by the surface energy of the solid-liquid interface, using up some of the free energy released by the transformation. Probability of homogeneous nucleation increases rapidly as liquid is undercooled.
Heterogeneous nucleation facilitates the process, with solid nuclei forming more readily on a pre-existing solid in contact with the liquid.

Each region grows by atoms transferring at the solid-liquid interface.

Growth continues until impingement of the solid regions occurs, with each nucleus having its own independent crystal orientation, causing a misfit in atomic packing where they impinge.

The individual crystallites are called grains, and the surfaces where they meet are grain boundaries. Grain structure is our first example of a microstructure formed by a phase transformation.

When any phase compositions change with temperature, a phase reaction is taking place. This only occurs in multi-phase regions.

**Dilute Alloys with Solubility Limits**

Considering a relatively dilute alloy in the Pb-Sn system, Pb-10wt% Sn
![[DiluteAlloys.png]]
* Above 305 degrees - no phase reaction
* From 305 to 270 degrees - liquidus line reached, the reaction liquid $\rightarrow$ solid starts. The proportion of liquid changes from 100% to 0%.
* From 270 to 150 degrees - no phase reaction
* Less than 150 - Precipitation stage. The compositions of the two solids change, each dissolves less of each other, a phase reaction takes place

The formation of the Sn-rich phase takes place by precipitation from the solid solution, involving nucleation and growth.

**Eutectic Solidification**

Two solid phases form simultaneously, with proportions and compositions governed by the tie-line through the eutectic point, called the eutectic reaction.
![[EutecticReactionPhaseDiagram.png]]
Eutectic reaction - a three-phase reaction be which, on cooling, a liquid transforms into two solid phases at constant temperature. Liquid, L $\rightarrow$ Solid, $\alpha$ + Solid, $\beta$

Pb and Sn infer-diffuse to generate solid regions in which each dominates
![[EutecticAlSi.png]]
Looks like plates of needles in (a) as the growth of the interface is planar at the atomic scale, and also because the boundary between phases is also a crystallographic boundary, with some pairs of orientations having a lower surface energy which will grow more rapidly.

If the V is located towards one end of the tie-line, then one phase forms a matrix containing the second phase as isolated particles.

A fine mixture of phases does mean that the area of interface per unit volume is large, so high surface energy.

**Off-Eutectic Solidification**

Just to the left or right of the eutectic point, like alloy C in the above phase diagram.
![[Off-EutecticCooling.png]]

After the liquidus line is reached at 235 degrees, nuclei of Pb-rich solid solution appear. This regime ends when the temperature reaches 183 degrees.
At 183 degrees, the remaining liquid has reached the eutectic point, so undergoes solidification. Nucleation of the eutectic will be straightforward, as already solid grains present to form on.
From 183 and below - The two types of microstructure evolve:
1) The primary Pb-rich solid becomes unstable and Sn-rich solid precipitates
2) The eutectic region evolves exactly as 100% eutectic did before: both phases change composition by inter-diffusion, becoming purer.

**Iron-Carbon**

**Cooling of Pure Iron -**
We start with FCC $\gamma$-iron. At 910 degrees, a solid-state change to BCC $\alpha$-iron occur. 
Nucleation starts at the grain boundaries, where there is more space. The $\alpha$ grains grow by atoms jumping across the boundary between the two phases. adopting the crystal structure of the growing phase as they do so.
When the growing $\alpha$ colonies impinge, new  $\alpha$-$\alpha$ grain boundaries are formed. Average grain size reduced by this transformation.

**The Eutectoid Reaction -**
Complete transformation from FCC austenite to BCC ferrite and cementite at constant eutectoid temperature.

Eutectoid reaction - Three - phase reaction by which, on cooling, a single phase solid transforms into two different solid phases at constant temperature.  Solid $\gamma$ $\rightarrow$ Solid $\alpha$ + Solid $\beta$

![[PearliteFormation.png]]

Nuclei of small plates of ferrite and cementite form at the grain boundaries of the austenite. These plates grow in tandem, consuming the austenite as they go, through local carbon diffusion.
The transformation is complete when the ferrite-cementite regions impinge, forming grain boundaries.

The eutectoid ferrite-cementite microstructure is called pearlite, though is still 2 phases.

The length scale of the plates in pearlite is much finer than in a eutectic, being formed by solid-state diffusion

**Phase Transformations in hypo-Eutectoid Steels**

Most carbon steels are "hypo-eutectoid", containing less than 0.8 wt%.
![[HypoEutectoid.png]]

At 820 degrees, we entre the two phase region: ferrite plus austenite. The formation of ferrite follows the same mechanism as in pure iron, nucleating on the austenite gran boundaries. The ferrite rejects carbon into the remaining austenite.

At 723 degrees, the remaining austenite is at the eutectoid point, decomposing into pearlite.
So now we have ferrite and pearlite (which contains ferrite too)

Iron carbide is a hard phase, and the pearlite structure is effective in obstructing dislocation motion, due to plate like structure.
As ferrite already had high strength and toughness, slow-cooled (normalised) carbon steels are very strong and tough.

The transformation also leads to a reduction in grain size, as each old grain nucleates more than one new grain.

We can do even better however, by quenching and tempering carbon steels. This heat treatment leads to the same phases but in a different morphology, enhancing the strength without loss of toughness.

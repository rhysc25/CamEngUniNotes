Phase diagrams provide some fundamental knowledge of what the equilibrium structure of a metallic or ceramic alloy is, as a function of temperature and composition. The real structure may not be the equilibrium one but it gives us an idea to work from

All parts of a material with the same atomic structure are a single phase

In mixtures, say for example a binary alloy (a mixture of two components (ternary would be 3)), each solid solution or chemical compound would be an identifiable phase

A metallic alloy is a mixture of a metal with other metals or non-metals. Ceramics too can be mixed to form ceramic alloys

The components are the chemical elements that make up alloys

Composition, sometimes written as $C_A$:
The weight % of component A:
$W_A=\frac{weight of component A}{\sum weights of all components}\times 100$
The atom (or mol) % of component A:
$X_A=\frac{number of atoms (or mols) of component A}{\sum number of atoms (or mols) of all components}\times 100$
$m = n \times mr$

The constitution of an alloy is described by:
- The phases present
- The weight fraction of each phase
- The composition of each phase
At thermodynamic equilibrium, the constitution is stable, no further tendency for it to change. Equilibrium constitution is defined at constant temperature and pressure, for a given alloy composition.

For a given composition held at fixed temperature T and pressure p, the Gibbs free energy G, is defined as:
$G=U+pV-TS=H-TS$

For the liquid and solid states most relevant to materials processing, U dominates the enthalpy (pV is small comparatively)

The equilibrium constitution is the state of lowest Gibbs free energy G, for a given composition, temperature and pressure. An alloy in this state shows no tendency to change.

Pressure has a limited influence on material processing, as pressure more deals with gases. Therefore we will just consider the material states to be controlled by temperature and composition.

Phase diagram: A diagram with temperature and composition as axes, showing the equilibrium constitution
![[PhaseDiagram1.png]]
There is no unique melting point past 0% B - this is known as partition. In the region between the two phase boundaries, liquid and solid are stable together.

Liquidus line limits the bottom of the liquid field
Solidus line limits the single phase solid field

![[IsomorphousPhaseDiagram.png]]
Isomorphous - single-structured. The solid state is a solid solution for all compositions

Upon melting a pure substance, the arrest point is the point at which the phase changes and the temperature is constant. The arrest point on cooling is due to the release of latent heat.

Alloys solidify over a range of temperatures. Latent heat is released progressively as temperature falls. The cooling curve does not show a shelf at constant temp, but the cooling rate is reduced by the progressive release of latent heat.

Pretty much all binary systems are not isomorphous. There is a limit to the amount of an element that can be dissolved in another. There is a solubility limit. 
At the solubility limit the solvent has become saturated.

![[SolubilityLimit.png]]
As temp increases solubility increases. The boundaries between the single and two-phase regions are known as solvus boundaries.

The lower limit of the single-phase liquid field formed by the intersection of two liquidus lines is called the eutectic point.

The state variables, temperature and composition, define a point on the phase diagram: the constitution point
When a phase diagram is traversed at a given temperature, crossing phase boundaries takes us from a one-phase field to a two-phase field or vice-versa

At a constitution point in a single-phase region, the phase composition is simply the composition of the alloy itself.
In two-phase regions, the phase compositions are given by the values on the phase boundaries at the ends of the tie-line (horizontal line on the phase diagram) through the constitution point. The phase compositions lie on the phase boundaries at either end of a horizontal tie-line through the constitution point

**The Lever Rule**
In a two-phase field at constant temperature, the compositions of the phases are fixed at the saturation limits, as mentioned above.
As a result, different compositions at this temperature will contain different proportions of each phase, in such a way as to conserve the overall fractions of the two elements
The proportions of each phase by weight in a two-phase region can be found from the phase diagram using the lever rule.

The tie-line is of length $l$, while the lengths of the segments to either side of the constitution point are $a$ and $b$ respectively.

The weight fractions of liquid and solid in the alloy are:
$F^L=a/l$ and $F^S=b/l$
Analogous to balancing two weights on either side of a pivot
![[LeverRule.png]]

If the densities of the phases are known, the volume fractions can be calculated from the weight fractions
Note that the proportions of the phases only vary linearly with composition along the tie-line if the diagram has a linear weight % scale. If it has atom % scale the lever rule cannot be applied

**Intermediate Compounds**

Many systems show intermediate phases: compounds which form between components. If the components are both metallic, they are called intermetallic compounds.
Thermodynamically, compounds form because the particular combination of components is able to form as a single phase with a specific lattice having lower free energy than, say, a mixture of two phases.

Compounds often have higher melting points

The atomic % of components in a compound is called its stoichiometry. 
The at% is easily identified from the formula

Compounds usually appear on phase diagrams with at% scaled at simple integer ratios. They therefore plot as a vertical line representing the single phase, with the compound then forming
one of the phases in both of the two phase fields to either side.

Idealistic compound phase diagram:
![[IntermediaryCompounds.png]]
There is a single phase field in between the two-phase fields,
it is one of the compounds – but the field has just collapsed to a single line.

More realistic:
![[CompoundPhaseDiagramRealistic.png]]
CuAl2 can tolerate a small amount of excess Al while remaining a
single phase. Most practical compounds show some tendency to form a solid solution over a small range of composition close to stoichiometric.
There is no rigorous definition as to how much spread in composition is allowed before it is not considered to be
a compound any more.

The iron-carbon phase diagram provides the basis for understanding all cast irons and carbon steels and their heat treatment.

Pure iron:
The low temperature form of iron is called ferrite ($\alpha$-iron), which has a BCC lattice. On heating pure iron changes to austenite ($\gamma$-iron) which has an FCC lattice. Then it changes to BCC $\delta$-iron, before melting then boiling.

The Fe-C phase diagram:
![[IronCarbonPhaseDiagram.png]]
This is up to 6.7wt% carbon, the region covering cast irons and carbon steels

A key characteristic of the iron-carbon system is the extent to which iron dissolves carbon in interstitial solid solution, forming single phases. 

The interstitial holes are larger in FCC than in BCC, leading to low solubility of carbon in BCC ferrite and $\delta$-iron, and much higher solubility in FCC austenite.

Iron carbide, $Fe_3C$, is given the name cementite

he lower limit of a single-phase solid field formed by two falling phase boundaries intersecting in a “V” is called a eutectoid point.
This is not to be confused with a eutectic point, where it's a liquid field above

At the very top of the austenite field, we have the peritectic point, the maximum temperature at which this single phase forms
This temperature coincides with the temperature at which $\delta$-iron has its maximum solubility
![[PeritecticPoint.png]]

Not a true equilibrium diagram as that would involve pure iron and free carbon, not cementite. However in most real world situations, cementite forms more easily than graphite, so we call it a pseudo-equilibrium diagram.
In **cast irons** with high carbon content, the conditions can favour graphite formation instead of cementite — so the “true” equilibrium diagram (Fe + graphite) becomes more relevant.

**More Complex Phase Diagrams**

'Eutec' means a normal "V" meeting a horizontal line, while 'peritec' means an inverted "V" meeting a horizontal line
-tic means a liquid phase is involved, while -toid means all phases are solid

![[KeyPointsOnPhaseDiagram.png]]

Peritectic point has liquid and solid above, peritectoid point has two solids above

**Ceramics**

Ceramics are mostly compounds of a metal with one of the elements O, C or N. They form with a specific stoichiometry, e.g. $Al_2O_3$. 

Phase diagrams for mixtures of ceramics work in exactly the same way as for metal systems, with the elements replaced by the pure compounds.

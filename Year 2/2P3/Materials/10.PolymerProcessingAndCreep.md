Polymers often used as low density and low cost. Their stiffness and strength is low, but per unit mass is actually good.
We can alter properties by changing monomers and side groups
We can add branches, or cross linking. Thermosets are the most heavily cross linked. For these, the molecular structure is fixed at the point of polymerisation.

Thermosets only have Van de Waals forces between chains. These soften at $T_g$, and completely disappear at $T_m$. This makes them easy to mould, re-melt and recycle

**Moulding Polymers**
We want to control the amount of crystallinity in our polymer. 
Density - Crystalline regions are more dense, so more shrinkage, which is a challenge for moulding processes.
Young's Modulus - Young's modulus increases with crystallinity. For a highly crystalline polymer, there will be little to no change at $T_g$, only a significant drop once the forces are fully overcome at $T_m$

Polymer chains rearrange by diffusion, so affected by temperature and time, so we can plot them on TTT diagrams.

At the unstable section, there is a thermodynamic driving force towards crystallinity.
Below $T_g$, the van der Waals bonds become stronger and chain mobility is inhibited, restricting further mobility.

Crystallisation occurs by the nucleation and growth of plate shaped 'lamellar' crystallites within the amorphous region. Radially arranged lamellar crystallites form structures called spherulites.

Large crystallites must also be avoided for many applications, as they block light causes the polymer to become opaque. To reduce crystallisation:
* Choose a more complex polymer - large side groups and branches - slow to rearrange - pushes c-curves further right
* Cool faster than the critical cooling rate, avoiding crystallisation. We need a small section thickness, and to chill the mould

**Deformation Processing of Thermoplastics**

The middle section is necking then drawing, where we align the molecules. Once they are fully aligned, the Young's modulus increases significantly as you are purely stressing the bonds. This is orientation strengthening.

This is taken advantage of in various applications like fibre drawing, stretch blow moulding, and film blowing

**Creep**

Creep is when plastic deformation is dependent on stress, temperature, and time. 
Creep enables plastic straining to occur at applied stresses that would be too low to cause yielding at room temperature.

We can model creep as like a spring dashpot system, where $\epsilon_{total}=\epsilon_{elastic}+\epsilon_{creep}$

With constant applied stress:

With constant applied strain:

Creep becomes significant at $T/T_m\approx0.5$

There are three main stages to creep:
![[Pasted image 20251201112335.png]]
Stage 1: Primary creep - dislocation motion
Stage 2: Steady-state creep - dominates the creep life, constant hinderance to dislocation motion
Stage 3: Tertiary creep - leads to rupture - voids nucleate

The steady state creep rate is well modelled by a power law dependence on the applied stress, at fixed temperature:
$\dot{\epsilon}_{ss}\propto\sigma^n$, which can be verified with a log log plot

We find that the constant of proportionality follows the Arrhenius law, so 
$\dot{\epsilon}_{ss}=A \exp(-\frac{Q}{RT}) \sigma^n$
We can find Q with log strain rate against 1 over T
The Arrhenius dependence hints that there must be diffusion involved

Creep mechanisms, both dependent on atomic diffusion:
1) Power law creep - dislocations stopped at obstacles, but temperature allows them to diffuse and climb into a different slip plane and continue gliding
2) Diffusion creep - A larger length scale. Atoms diffuse along grain boundaries or through the crystal, allowing grains to elongate in the direction of applied tensile stress. The creep exponent is about 1, also called linear viscous creep.

The larger the grain size, the larger the diffusion distances required, lower grain boundary area, so slower diffusion creep

Failure during creep -
Creep failure begins when voids nucleate, reducing the load bearing cross section and increasing the stress

The overall time to failure $t_f$ at a given stress often follows the empirical Monkman-Grant relationship: $t_f\dot{\epsilon}_{ss}=C$, where C is the critical strain at failure.

Creep mechanism maps -
Axes of log stress and temperature, contours of constant strain rate, showing regions where a particular mechanism dominates.
The creep mechanism map can be used to calculate the value of the creep exponent n:
* Within an interval of strain rates within a single creep regime, read off the change in stress between a pair of strain rate contours
* $\Delta[\log_{10}\dot{\epsilon}_{ss}]=n\Delta[\log_{10}\sigma]$
* Therefore find n

To find the rate of elongation of a turbine blade, we need to find $\sigma_r$ by integrating $\frac{d\sigma}{dr}=-\rho \omega^2 r$
We also need to find the overall rate of elongation by integrating the local strain rate over the length:
$\dot{\epsilon}_{ss}(r)=A \exp(-\frac{Q}{RT}) (\sigma(r))^n$
$\frac{dL}{dt}=\int_{R1}^{R2}\dot{\epsilon}_{ss}(s)dr$

How to make our turbine blades more creep resistant:
1) Use a more creep resistant alloy, one with a higher melting temp, preferably alloyed to hinder dislocation motion.
2) Grain size control during casting. We want larger grain size as atoms diffuse most easily along grain boundaries. We want to force columnar grains. We can do this by partially pulling the material out of the furnace. Optimally, we want a single grain for the entire piece, so we solidify in a spiral, filtering out all but one grain orientation
3) Blade cooling - cool the blade with embedded air channels. Use a thermally insulating barrier coating

Transformations are governed by thermodynamics and kinematics.
Kinematic give transformations a time aspect. The key mechanism is diffusion, how particles move through a material

Each particle is oscillating, with an equally likely chance to move left or right. However if more particles are on the right, more will move left, causing a spreading out.

Each molecule undergoes random motion characterised by two parameters:
1) A length scale $\lambda$: in a gas this could represent the mean free path
2) A time scale $\tau$: in a gas this might represent the time between molecular collisions

Brownian motion: The resulting random trajectory of a diffusing particle due to thermal fluctuations. This leads to diffusion

For a random walk of polymer monomers, we found that $\sigma^2=na^2$
If we place a diffusing molecule at the origin and wait for a time t, it has made $t/\tau$ steps of size $\lambda$, so $\sigma^2=\frac{t}{\tau}\lambda^2$, so during a time t, the particles move an average of $\sqrt{\frac{\lambda^2 t}{\tau}}$
$\lambda^2/\tau$ is a diffusion constant, characterising the rate

By considering the concentrations $C(x)$ and $C(x+dx)$ in cubes of length $\lambda$, and netting the molecules jumping between the two gives $J_x=-\frac{\lambda^2}{6\tau}\frac{\partial C}{\partial x}$, where $J$ is the net flux of molecules in molecules per second per unit area
This is stated in Fick's first law: $J=-D\frac{dC}{dx}$

Finding two different equations for the number of diffusing atoms $dn_{cv}$ and combining gives this expression: $\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial J}{\partial x}$ which, combining with Fick's first law gives Fick's second law:
$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=D\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$

Modelling statistically:
In a continuum model, we may model a set amount of material at a given location as a delta function of the concentration at $t=0$
The solution is a Normal distribution at mean 0 and variance $2Dt$
A particle would indeed diffuse with a displacement following a normal distribution, with its spread increasing as t increases

**Processes for Diffusion in Solids**

1) Bulk interstitial diffusion - small interstitial solute atoms move between the interstitial sites in a crystal lattice. Fast diffusion rate
2) Bulk vacancy diffusion - Substitutional solute atoms exchange with a vacancy in the crystal structure. Slow diffusion rate
3) Short-circuit diffusion along a grain boundary - Planar route along grain boundary where crystal packing is more open. Fast diffusion rate
4) Short-circuit diffusion along dislocation cores - Linear route where the atomic spacing around a dislocation core exceeds that in a perfect crystal. Fast diffusion rate

Considering the interstitial bulk diffusion, there is a very unfavourable location between the two interstitial sites, which acts as an energy barrier to the movement.

The average energy per atom: $E=3k_BT$
However according to statistical physics, the probability of an atom having an energy greater than q is: $p=\exp(-\frac{q}{k_BT})$

The rate $1/\tau$ at which the atom moves through the lattice will be $\propto p$
Therefore $J_x\propto \exp(-\frac{q}{k_BT})\frac{\partial C}{\partial x}$

**Arrhenius Law**
Processes which follow this type of exponential temperature dependence are known as thermally activated. A definition of a thermally activated process is given by the Arrhenius law:
Rate of process $\propto \exp(-\frac{Q}{RT})$
We can find out whether a process follows this law by plotting $\ln(rate)$ against $1/T$

The coefficient of diffusion in solids follows the Arrhenius law:
$D=D_0 \exp(-\frac{Q}{RT})$

It is also possible to get net flow as a result of a thermodynamic driving force which biases the probabilities to go over an energy barrier. E.g. change of free energy due to a phase transformation

Consider the growth rate of a solid-liquid interface for $T<T_m$
The variation of free energy per atom is $\pm \Delta G$
![[Pasted image 20251030111317.png]]

The rate of transformation from liquid to solid is $p_{LS}=\exp{(-\frac{q-\Delta G/2}{k_BT}})$, and from solid to liquid is $p_{SL}=\exp{(-\frac{q+\Delta G/2}{k_BT}})$
The growth rate of the solid phase will be proportional to $p_{LS}-p_{SL}$, so proportional to $(\frac{T_m-T}{T})\exp{(\frac{-q}{k_BT})}$, after replacing $\Delta G$ for the expression in terms of H

This depends on temperature in two opposing ways, one way increases the energy barrier, and the other increases the probability that the particle has energy above that energy barrier. This gives an optimum temperature

**Nucleation**

Nucleation is another example of activated process. 
At a quantitative level, nucleation requires:
* Some small scale fluctuations to get atoms to move around
* The fluctuations of energy of the other $\Delta G^*$ bringing together a nucleus of size $r^*$
Therefore rate is expected to vary with temperature like: $\exp{(-\frac{\Delta G^*}{k_b T})}\exp{(-\frac{q}{k_BT})}$
There is a trade off between having enough energy for atoms to move about vs how large the energy barrier is, whether that be $\Delta G^*$ or $q$

We can apply this knowledge of diffusion to silicon doping, is that the dopant diffuses into the material. 2 stages:
* Pre-deposition: Sets the amount of dopant
* Drive-in: Spreads the dopant across the material

The drive in stage occurs just as normal diffusion, with the area of the curve (amount of dopant) remaining constant, but the depth spreading out like $\sqrt{Dt}$

Considering now the pre-deposition phase, which sets the amount of dopant available to drive in:
These diffusion depths are much much smaller than that of the drive-in stage
![[Pasted image 20251030112647.png]]
During a time t, the typical distance travelled is $\sqrt{Dt}$
Therefore we can expect the amount pre-deposited to be of the order of $C_s\sqrt{Dt}$

Numerically: As we can say that the concentration of an element at the next time step depends on the concentration of its neighbours at the current time step: $c_{i,n+1}=\frac{1}{2}(c_{i-1,n}+c_{i+1,n})$
The exact solution is $C_s(1-erf{(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}})})$
Where the error function is the integral under the normal curve
If we integrate this expression with respect to x, we get that $N(t)=\frac{2C_s\sqrt{Dt}}{\sqrt{\pi}}$

Therefore the amount of introduced material grows like $\sqrt{t}$, very typical of a diffusion process
